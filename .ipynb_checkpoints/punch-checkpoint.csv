The spokesperson for the Police Service Commission, Ikechukwu Ani, revealed the details in a correspondence obtained by our correspondent on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Ani noted that the Chairman of the PSC, Dr Solomon Arase, has expressed concern about the continued disinterest of South East youths in pursuing a career in the Nigeria Police Force.      
“Arase noted that the South East, currently a hotbed for nonstate actors’ rebellion in the country, should have been at the forefront to join the Nigeria Police Force and bring indigenous solutions to the menace. He called on the leadership of the zone to find a way of convincing its youths to embrace the opportunity the ongoing recruitment has provided.
“The PSC Chairman said it will be difficult for anybody to listen to cries of marginalisation from leaders of the zone if they choose to remain indifferent to the government’s generous decision to offer employment to Nigerian youths in the Police Force. He said they should maximise the remaining five weeks open for their youths to get into the train,” Ani said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/27184052/Police-recruitment.jpg

The PUNCH reports that on October 15, following a distress call about a robbery incident at the residence of one Dayo Balogun of Zone B Apo resettlement, police operatives from Apo division swiftly mobilised to the scene and apprehended one Ogbonna Ezechukwu of Area 1.
The FCT Commissioner of Police, Haruna Garba, during a parade on Wednesday, revealed that Ezechukwu is a notorious and wanted armed robber who has broken into many homes within Apo axis with members of his gang who are presently at large.
“A bag containing gold earrings, a laptop, four wristwatches, and other valuables was recovered from the suspect. He is assisting the Police in an effort to arrest his accomplices on the run. 
In a similar development, on October 15, police operatives from Mpape Division, while on routine patrol, arrested one Musa Ayelolo, a tipper driver and recovered a locally made pistol with two live cartridges from him. The suspect will be charged to court at the conclusion of the investigation,” CP Garba noted.
On October 17, an informant and logistic supplier to a gang of kidnappers, Muhammed Suleman, aka Bardi, was trailed and arrested by the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the Command, following credible intelligence.
In the course of interrogation by the police, the suspect confessed to being an informant and food supplier to bandits terrorising Mpape, Bwari, and Byazhin axis and getting a usual ₦10,000 to ₦15,000 rewards for carrying out the tasks.      
The FCT CP noted that Suleman, who is now cooperating with the police to arrest other gang members currently at large, is also a close associate of wanted bandit leaders – Buba and Nasiru (surnames unknown).
Meanwhile, following a report by one Sunday Idemudo that his ash-coloured Toyota Corolla car Reg No: ENU 104 JZ 2023 was discovered to have been removed from where it was parked at Michael Opara Way, Wuse zone 5, at the close of work on October 16, police operatives from Utako Division swung into action, tracked and recovered the vehicle at Tollgate, Kaduna State with the help of Reconstructive Digital Analysis (Tracking).
Two suspects – Mohammed Yunusa and Ibrahim Haliru were arrested in possession of the car and are now cooperating with the police to apprehend other accomplices currently on the run.
Also, the new ‘Operation Sting and anti-one chance squad,’ created by the FCT Police Command in an effort to rid the city of one chance activities, carried out coordinated operations and impounded nine tinted vehicles suspected to be used for one chance activities.
The vehicles impounded include a red Golf with Reg. No. ABJ 897 DC; White Peugeot 206 with Reg. No. JJJ 638; Ford Vita Black with Reg. No RBC 567 MK; Nissan Almeira with Reg. No. AWK 260 IB; Toyota Corolla Gold in Colour with Reg. No. ABJ 590 AE; Mazda 323 Protege with Reg. No. RBC 258 XC; Toyota Corolla Gold in colour with Reg. No. LD 364; Toyota Corolla with Reg. No. YAB 561 EH Black in colour, and a vehicle with Reg. No. ABJ 597 TH.
In the same vein, on October 22, police operatives from CPS, while on routine patrol, intercepted a Gold coloured Toyota Corolla with hand-inscribed Reg. No. RSH 287 is suspected to be used for one-chance activities at phase 1 Federal Secretariat.  Related News   Army arrests 10 suspected kidnappers, cultists in Edo, Bayelsa  Kidnappers on the rampage  JUST IN: 27 women, four boys allegedly kidnapped in Southern Kaduna   
“On sighting police operatives, the suspect took to his heels leaving behind both the car and the victim whom he had attempted to rob. In the course of searching the vehicle, a locally made pistol, jack knife and a rope were recovered from the vehicle,” Garba revealed.        
On October 20, police operatives from the anti-violent crime section of the Command arrested one Aliru Shuaibu and recovered a Hyundai Accent Car with Reg. No AAA 903 CG, being the property of one Yusuf Ibrahim, is reported to have been stolen from No. 3 Gwarimpa Estate Abuja on 28/09/2023.
The CP further advised members of the public to rethink handing over their original particulars to their servants or drivers while noting that a preliminary investigation by the police revealed that the suspect, who was a driver to the owner of the vehicle, removed the vehicle from the house and was able to sell it because the original particulars of the vehicle were in his possession.
On the same day, police operatives at Utako Division received a distress call that a Toyota Prado SUV jeep with Reg. No. KWL 276 CL was snatched at gunpoint from the owner at Utako by armed hoodlums.
The police operatives, however, gave the hoodlums a hot chase, forcing them to abandon the vehicle and take to their heels. The vehicle was recovered within two hours and has since been released to the owner.
Earlier on October 18, one Abubakar Umar, who specialises in receiving stolen items from a nine-man armed robbery gang, was arrested via actionable intelligence.
Umar’s arrest led to the arrest of three other members of the notorious armed robbery syndicate, namely – Ahmed Umar, Gadafi Suraju, and Abubakar Sadiq Umar, who carried out a robbery operation behind Customary Court, Arab Road Kubwa, on 03/09/2023.
Several stolen items, such as laptops, iPads, mobile phones, and television sets, amongst others, were recovered from the suspects, who have all confessed to the robbery and will be charged in court after investigation.      
Meanwhile, on October 23, police operatives from the Maitama Division, while on routine patrol, arrested one Shamsu Umar, who is a member of a three-man gang, while trying to rob one Mrs Aisha Hakeem and her husband along the Maitama expressway. The hoodlums swooped on them while the couple stopped to fix their broken-down vehicle.
CP Garba noted that the modus operandi of this gang is to patrol the expressway with their motorcycle, and when any person is found standing alone waiting to board a vehicle, or while the vehicle has a mechanical fault, as in this instant case, they move in to dispossess their victims of their valuables.
“The motorcycle used in the operation has been impounded, and the suspect is in custody assisting the Police to apprehend his gang members.
In conclusion, therefore, I wish to reassure you that the FCT Police Command, under my leadership, will do all that is humanly possible to prevent crime and criminality, but when it does occur, to detect it. To all law-abiding residents of the FCT, I wish to solicit your support and cooperation in the spirit of community policing. Together, we shall defeat crime in the FCT,” Garba said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/30142722/FCT-Police-PRO-Josephine-Adeh.jpg

The commendation came on Wednesday through UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed who lauded Governor Mohammed Bago for hosting the first-ever green economy summit in Nigeria.
The summit was held in Minna, the Niger State capital, on Tuesday.
This is just as she reminded political leaders across the country not to forget that advanced nations are gradually dumping oil-driven economies in preference for greener energy. 
The UN Deputy Secretary-General said Nigeria must set a shift and chart a new way forward that leaves no one behind by investing in the transition to clean energy from renewable sources.
Investment in the green economy, she stressed, would unlock latent potential and throw up employment opportunities in Niger State and the country at large.
“These challenges have no boundaries and have numerous cross-generational impacts. So as we examine opportunities to build green economic pathways, we need to keep in mind that most of the world’s natural resources are in Africa. And in Niger State, you are blessed with an abundance of mineral resources. Niger is uniquely positioned to be one of the first movers to engaging green growth and to become a leader by investing in energy.

“But these must include bold investments into the state’s strongest assets, which are its people. People are not just the key target of development; they are also the agents of its change.
“Dear friends, this would require leadership, commitment, and partnership to identify integrated solutions that respond to the complex issues. Allow me to focus on one area. Energy.
“The days of oil-driven energy growth are numbered. While our global progress on meeting the climate emergency is still too slow, the direction of travel is unambiguous. There is no long-term future for oil.
“Globally, we need to end our addiction to fossil fuels while building baseload and expanding access to reliable, clean, and affordable energy for everyone. In Nigeria, we face a situation where 36 per cent of households do not have access to the electricity grid and where we remain almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels for electricity generation.
“Nigeria must set a shift and chart a new way forward that leaves no one behind by investing in the transition to clean energy from renewable sources. Niger has the potential to be the trailblazer on this path. Investing in the green economy would unleash the next great wave of human and sustainable development, particularly for our youths,” she said.
According to her, a lot can be achieved in the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals if sufficient investment is made in protecting the environment from unnecessary exploitation.
“Let’s continue this journey together to ensure that people, especially women and planets thrive, building a just, sustainable, and resilient world that leaves no one behind. Let us take that journey together,” she added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/05182234/Mohammed-Bago.jpeg

Ortom, who spoke in a statement issued by his media aide, Terver Akase, advised  Alia to stop hallucinating and to focus on how to use huge funds accrued to his administration from the federation account to address development challenges. 
The former governor was reacting to the revelation made by the state Commissioner of Justice, Fidelis Mnyim, that the government of Alia inherited over N14 billion consent judgment incurred by the immediate past government. 
Mnyim explained that the judgment debts fell into garnishing, which all bordered on several unpaid contracts and 34 months of unpaid pension.  
The commissioner had said, “These group of people became so aggressive and filed cases against the State government. 
“When we came in, we had over N14 billion consent judgment.

The immediate past governor said the state government had an agreement with the retirees and was paying their arrears of pensions and gratuities as funds permitted.       
The statement read in parts, “This was even as the economic situation in the country was severe with federal allocations to states at their lowest since 1999, and Nigeria had plunged into recession at two different times. 
“If the present government is complaining about numerous garnishee orders, there is the possibility that it has defaulted on the payment arrangement that the Ortom administration made with the pensioners and the retirees have returned to the courts. 
“Interestingly, the current Commissioner for Justice, Fidelis Mnyim, served as counsel to some persons who took the Benue State Government to court. 
“He ought to have told the media if the case he handled was among the garnishee orders resulting in the N14 billion that he claimed.” 
Ortom, however, advised his successor that “When a new government assumes power, it inherits both assets and liabilities,” adding that he, also like his predecessors, inherited similar financial obligations.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/27192403/Gov-Ortom-Rev.-Fr.-Hyacinth-Alia.jpg

In a statement released Wednesday on the official Facebook page of the Commission, the operatives were on a routine verification exercise on Tuesday, October 24, 2023, when the attack happened.
According to the EFCC, the operatives were on the premises to affirm the “address and identity of one Oluwakemi, who stood as a surety for Alakinde Khalid Kolawole, a suspected internet fraudster in the custody of the Commission.”
The statement titled ‘Unprovoked Attack on EFCC Operatives in Ibadan: Call for Caution’, read, “Seven operatives of the Ibadan Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on routine verification exercise of a surety: Azeez Kazeem Oluwakemi were, on Tuesday, October 24, 2023, attacked and held hostage by staff and students of the Federal College of Forestry, Idi-shin Estate, Ibadan, Oyo State. 

“The operatives were in the college to authenticate the address and identity of Oluwakemi, who stood as a surety for Alakinde Khalid Kolawole, a suspected internet fraudster in the custody of the Commission. A surety verification exercise is a standard law enforcement practice for the perfection of the bail conditions of a suspect.

“Two main entrance gates to the college were barricaded with a car believed to be owned by one of the lecturers of the college. The bus that conveyed operatives to the college was vandalized, even as students and staff of the college threw stones and dangerous objects at the vehicle.
“A rescue team that came successfully released the seven operatives held hostage by the riotous crowd.
It is noteworthy that operatives of the Commission exercised restraint in the face of the unprovoked attack and refrained from applying any force against the belligerent attackers.

“No student or staff of the college was shot, as armed operatives merely fired into the air to disperse the unruly crowd.

The exercise which will take place from 10 am to 4 pm., will “produce a loud bang that would be heard from far and near,” Director, Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu stated on Wednesday via the army’s handle on X (formerly Twitter).
PUNCH had earlier reported that the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Taoreed Lagbaja, had ordered the clearance of unexploded explosive ordnance at the site of the bomb blast.
The statement read that the COAS, during the flag-off of three training exercises at the cantonment, inaugurated ‘Exercise Clean Sweep’ with the objective to “completely disinfect the epicentre of the Ikeja bomb blast and clear it of all verified and suspected remaining unexploded explosive ordnances lying around the cantonment.” 
However, Nwachukwu stated that the exercise “has reached an advanced stage, resulting in the recovery of various calibres of unexploded ordnances, which will have to be professionally and safely disposed of.
“In line with the exercise plan, as earlier highlighted during the inauguration press briefing and flag off by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Taoreed Lagbaja on 10 October 2023, the Nigerian Army would be conducting disposal of recovered unexploded ordnances at the Nigerian Army Range in Owode, Ajilete, Ogun State on Friday 27 October 2023 from 10 am to 4 pm.

Shettima stated that ...","<span class=""post-date""> 25th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/shettima-woos-foreign-investors-for-agric-sector/,  Ajisafe Olayiwola,"Vice President Kashim Shettima, on Tuesday, urged foreign investors to invest in the nation’s agricultural sector, assuring them that the country is ready for agribusiness.
Shettima stated that owing to the country’s “70 million hectares of under-utilised arable land” which is “75 per cent of the country’s total land mass,” Nigeria is posited as the best place for such investment.
Shettima noted the significance between food and national security, adding that the world needs to be alarnmed, following instances of the COVID-19 pandemic and “geopolitical frictions.”
This was contained in a State House statement released on Wednesday by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Communications (Office of the Vice President), Stanley Nkwocha. 
PUNCH Online reported that Shettima, on Sunday, October 22, arrived in Iowa, United States, for the African Development Bank’s World Food Prize-facilitated Norman E. Borlaug International Dialogue.
The Norman E. Borlaug International Dialogue, also referred to as the ‘Borlaug Dialogue,’ is a gathering of individuals from more than 65 countries fully prepared to address cutting-edge issues related to global food security and nutrition.
Speaking at this year’s edition, with the theme, ‘Harnessing Change,’ the Vice President told the gathering that “under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s watch, Nigeria has since demonstrated that the Agrifood sector was a top priority.”      
He also noted that “there were substantial opportunities in Nigeria for local and foreign investors to boost agricultural productivity.”
According to Nkwocha, while delivering his address titled, ‘Nigeria’s Agribusiness Roadmap for a Prosperous Future,’ Shettima said, “Our primary objective is to empower our farmers and attract investors. We are increasing primary production to harness the economic potential of agro-processing and industrialisation. This is why, upon assuming office, the President declared a state of emergency in agriculture.
“The connection between food and national security is too significant for us not to be alarmed by happenings around the world, whether in response to unforeseen disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic or the geopolitical frictions around us.”
The VP stated that in order to create profound economic opportunities for investors, the country has enabled interventions such as the “National Agriculture Growth Scheme (NAGS), the Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), the Livestock Productivity and Resilience Support Project (L-PRES), the Green Imperative Project (GIP) and the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZ) programmes.”
The statement read in parts, “Allow me to share that Nigeria understands the essence of partnerships in sustaining the dreams and promises that have brought us together today. This is why we are already collaborating with institutions such as the African Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Islamic Development Bank, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to achieve food and nutrition security in Nigeria and beyond.
“With the invaluable support of our partners, we are exploring innovative strategies to transform this quest for food security into a thriving enterprise.”  Related News   Nigerian startups showcase solutions, woo foreign investors in Dubai  Shettima arrives US for AfDB World Food Prize event  AfDB, AGF approve $1.2bn loan for women-led businesses   
Shettima highlighted critical areas Nigeria was assisting its farmers to increase productivity, including essential infrastructure for industries to increase their capacity.        
He said, “With about 70 million hectares of underutilised arable land, which is 75 per cent of our total land area, Nigeria offers a substantial opportunity to both local and foreign investors to boost agricultural productivity. This is why we’ve embraced the TAAT, GIP, and SAPZ programmes and are investing in agricultural research through the National Agricultural Development Fund (NADF).
“This is why we are helping our farmers increase production and providing essential infrastructure for industries in peri-urban areas to expand their capacity. This, yes this, is the wisdom for our resolve to establish Mechanization Service Centres in all our 774 Local Government Areas to facilitate essential primary production services.”
He further stated that, while much of the demand for agribusiness products was satisfied through imports, the Tinubu administration is dedicated to reversing Nigeria’s over-reliance on importation.
VP Shettima noted that apart from the fact that its strategic location in West Africa provides easy access to regional and international markets, Nigeria was also poised to dismantle investment barriers.
This, he said, is being achieved through a supportive policy framework such as the National Agricultural Technology and Innovation Policy.
He continued: “Because we believe that import rules are a significant factor, we’ve established a policy of zero duties on agricultural machinery and imposed restrictions on certain agricultural commodities to stimulate local production. We are also offering preferential financing and subsidies, exemplified by an agricultural credit guarantee scheme that guarantees up to 75% of loans for agricultural ventures.
“We’ve also introduced a range of tax incentives, including tax holidays, deductions for locally sourced materials, labour incentives, and pioneer status incentives, making it easier to conduct business. Notably, we’ve opened the doors to foreign investors, allowing them to have 100% ownership in companies and repatriate their profits and dividends without hindrance.”      
Shetrtima pointed out that the country was “committed to the journey towards a world where food security and nutrition are not luxuries but fundamental rights for all.”
Earlier at the dialogue, President, World Food Prize Foundation, and former U.S. Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, described Shettima as a “rare African statesman whose leadership qualities, loyalty as well as sense of commitment to nationhood and development can best be described as legendary.”
The statement added, “He expressed optimism that the Tinubu-led administration would be successful given its devotion to results-oriented diplomacy.
“Attending the dialogue with the Vice President are governors of Plateau State, Barr. Caleb Mutfwang, Miinister of Agriculture, Sen. Abubakar Kyari; Consul General (New York), Amb. Lot Egopija, and Senior Special Assistant to the President on Agribusiness and Productivity Enhancement (Office of the Vice President), Dr Kingsley Uzoma, among others.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/25135800/sHETTIMA-aFdb.jpg

This was made known in a statement signed by the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan, and made available to journalists by her Director of Communications, Mohammed Ahmed, on Wednesday.
According to the statement, a two-week verification, which will end on Friday, October 27, 2023, was put in place as an act of magnanimity for officers who did not participate in the earlier verifications.
“Adequate arrangements were put in place for a smooth exercise in designated areas of the FCT, however, the officers’ impatience and lack of orderliness in the first two days made the exercise rowdy. This has been duly addressed and the two-week exercise, scheduled to end on Friday, October 27, 2023, is progressing very well. 
“The verification of records of all civil servants will be finalised at the end of the ongoing exercise and any officer whose record could not be verified will be delisted from the payroll of government,” the statement read.
It recalled that in 2013, the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, being the repository of official records and information on all public servants, was saddled with the responsibility of cleansing the record on the payroll.

The office, it added, carried out aggressive sensitisation and publicity via official, conventional, and social media.
According to the statement, an initial period of three months was given for compliance, which was extended to one year, May 2018, to enable all officers to update their records.
The statement added, “Sequel to another wide publicity accompanied by numerous pre-verification sensitisation visits by IPPIS staff to Ministries, extra-ministerial Departments, and Agencies nationwide, the second phase of the exercise, the physical verification, commenced in 2018.
“In this regard, 500 staff from the OHCSF were trained and deployed, in well-communicated and coordinated phases, to the 36 states of the Federation and the FCT between 2018 and 2019 to enable officers to carry out the physical verification in their states and save them to from traveling to Abuja.”
The statement further maintained that some erring officers’ pleas to be given the last opportunity to comply were granted, adding that the portal was, therefore, reopened from October 3-13, 2023, for them to update their records and now to Friday, October 27, 2023, before action is taken on defaulters.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/05013254/Folasade-Yemi-Esan-.jpg

Yohanna, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party replaces Abbo, who was sacked by the Appeal Court last week Monday.
The Court of Appeal, Abuja had sacked Abbo, a member of the All Progressives Congress. 
Delivering judgment on Monday, the three-member panel presided over by Justice C.E. Nwosu-Iheme, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to issue a Certificate of Return to Yohanna as the duly elected lawmaker representing the area in the National Assembly.
The appellate vacated the tribunal judgment which had earlier affirmed Abbo of the All Progressives Congress as the winner of the senatorial election.

But aggrieved by the electoral body’s decision, the PDP, Yohanna, went to the tribunal to challenge the outcome of the election.
In its ruling, the tribunal dismissed Yohanna’s petition for lacking in merit.
Not comfortable with the judgment of the tribunal, the PDP candidate, through his counsel Johnson Usman, SAN, approached the Appeal Court.
The Court of Appeal, after hearing arguments from parties, agreed with Usman that based on Section 137 of the Electoral Act, 2022, the results tendered clearly showed that there was no compliance with the Electoral Act.
The court, thereafter, deducted the invalid votes from both parties and found that Yohanna and the PDP won the election by a majority of lawful votes.
In the wake of the judgment, Senator Abbo described it as a coup on democracy but told his supporters to be calm.

Nwoko, while narrating his ordeal on Tuesday, said Akazue promised to give him $20m, a house, and a driving job in the US, but since undergoing the kidney transplant at a popular hospital in Lagos State on December 22, 2018, Akazue has failed to honour his promises.
Prior to undergoing the transplant, the aggrieved man said his boss warned him against informing members of his family.
He also said Akazue brought his younger sister, Deborah, to act as his wife, who signed the consent form at the hospital before the transplant. 
After undergoing the transplant and being discharged from the hospital, Nwoko said his boss moved him into a one-room apartment in Mowe, adding that one week after the surgery, Akazue ordered him to return to work despite still recuperating.
Narrating how life has been since the transplant, Nwoko claimed he is now always tired and is no longer as agile as he used to be before the transplant.
He added that since the day he was discharged, the family had never bothered to care for his health.      
Nwoko said, “I was employed as a driver for Mr Akazue in November 2018. His brother, Osinach, had a kidney issue, so when my boss travelled, I was driving his brother to the hospital for dialysis every three days. When my boss returned, he called me into his office and told me that his brother’s kidney had failed.
“He said in the next one or two weeks, his brother may die. He asked if I would like to donate one of my kidneys for his brother and said if I donated the kidney, he would give me $20m, a house in America, and will also get me a driving job in America.
“I said I would do it and the next day, we went to the hospital where they ran tests and told me my kidney would match his. The next day, Akazue’s brothers, another of his in-laws, one Mr Joe, and I went back to the hospital, we stayed three days after which the surgery was done.”
Nwoko said one week after he was discharged, he exhausted  his drugs, adding that since 2018 to date, he had not received any treatment as Akazue abandoned him.

“All the promises my boss made me, he didn’t fulfil them. Whenever I asked my boss about it, he’d tell me not to worry, that I was still in his mind. On October 13, 2023, I realised what had happened and told my parents about what I was going through,” Nwoko added.
Furthermore, his salary was increased to N70,000 after the transplant, but he never received the full salary because N30,000 was always deducted if he missed any day at work.
He explained that his family lodged a complaint at the Zone 2 Command, where the Assistant-Inspector General, Muhammed Ali, detailed his men, and Akazue was arrested on Sunday, October 22.        
Asked about the whereabouts of Osinachi, Nwoko’s counsel, Abdullai Dania, said Akazue told the police to go find him themselves.
The counsel described Nwoko’s case as a case of organ theft, noting that “his kidney was taken from him deceitfully and fraudulently.”
Dania added, “This is stealing somebody’s organ. We don’t know what he used to hypnotise the man; if he is going to settle this matter, he should pay N500m to the victim. If he won’t, we will take legal action while the criminal aspect will go on.”
Calls put through to the receiver of the donated kidney, Osinachi, did not go through as his two numbers were switched off.
When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Zone 2 Command, Hauwa Idris-Adamu, requested to know the department that arrested the suspect.
She promised to get back to our correspondent but had yet to do so as of the time this report was filed.
Subsequent calls made to her mobile number were unanswered, and she did not reply the text message sent to her number for further updates regarding Nwoko’s case.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/25102824/Lagos-driver.jpeg

PUNCH Metro gathered that the suspect claimed he decided to raze the bank after his several complaints that an unauthorised N500,000 was debited from his account fell on deaf ears.
Our correspondent further learnt that he was said to have been advised by the Area Commander, Metro, Abeokuta, that he should allow the bank to follow its procedure in unraveling the circumstances behind the deduction when he reported the matter.
However, PUNCH Metro learnt that the matter took a turn for the worse after the bank told him that he had been defrauded. 
After receiving the news from the bank official who attended to him, our correspondent learnt that Rufai was said to have gone back to the bank with petrol and began to sprinkle it on the banking hall.
While the drama was unfolding, some customers scampered for safety, while others, along with the bank security staff members, wrestled Rufai to the ground before he could use the lighter in his hand.

PUNCH Metro gathered that the bank’s Chief Security Officer, Godwin James, handed the suspect to the Ibara Police Division.      
Meanwhile, during interrogation, the suspect was said to have claimed that he took the action to attract the attention of the necessary authorities about what the bank did with his money.
Speaking with our correspondent on Wednesday, the state police Public Relations Officer, Omolola Odutola, said Rufai would be charged with attempted suicide and murder.
Odutola said, “He was fighting a noble cause in an ignoble way. He has a right to make a complaint that his money is missing. But the way he went about it was wrong. We are going to hold him for an attempt to commit suicide with murder because if he had succeeded, he would have killed himself and every other person in the bank.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/10073209/Omolola-Odutola.jpg

Sani also described the presence of the former Governor of Rivers State in the ruling party as the ‘hand of Esau’.in the PDP and the ‘voice of Jacob’ urged him to quit the PDP because of distrust.
According to the Kaduna-based politician, this will give Wike the opportunity to work excellently for President Tinubu as the FCT Minister and without distractions.
Sani argued that it would be honourable for the politician to exit the PDP so that it can effectively play its role as the main opposition party in the current political dispensation in the country. 
The vocal northern senator stated these in an exclusive interview with Arewa Punch, adding, “Asiwaju (President) wants to send a message that he does not betray those who work for his own emergence.
“As long as Wike remains in the PDP, it won’t be a relevant party because it will never be relevant in its scheme of opposition. Because they will control the structure of the party and ensure that whoever will emerge will not be a serious threat to the APC.
“PDP is still afraid of taking action against those who undermined its victory and it will confine it to irrelevance as far as it has no punishment for anti-party elements because as long as there are people who have one leg in the PDP and one in APC, PDP will never fly and nobody is going to take the PDP seriously as far as party politics is concerned.      
“Once it has become the appendage of the  APC because for Wike to remain in the PDP, is to make sure it never plays the role of an opposition party. He is the hand of Esau in PDP, the voice of Jacob in APC,” he remarked.
Continuing, he stressed, “My own advice is for Nyesome Wike to simply decamp to APC where he will be able to serve the party and also leave PDP to claim its role as an opposition.
“It will be more respectable for him to join the APC and work without being distrusted by both sides because if he continues to divide his legs between the APC and the PDP, he will live as a very confuse, disorganise man with an unstable political career.  Related News   Multiple taxation: Tinubu panel asks govt to drop 190 taxes, OPS blames states  I never promised Tinubu unconditional support- Dele Momodu tells APC  Tinubu lauds Ooni of Ife at 49   
“So, as far as I am concerned, he has a lot to deliver. As Minister of FCT, I have no doubt about his capacity as a performer. One that will bring sanity to Abuja and so many changes, but he is still being seen as a Judas and the position is occupying is his own 30 pieces of silver and that is not a good position.
“The best thing is for him to decamp so that he can work very well for President Bola Tinubu  and also for the APC.”
Sani observed that with the current political situation in the country, the main opposition party had found itself in an “uncomfortable” position of not being able to deal with those who worked against its electoral victory in the 2023 general elections.
“There’s is no doubt about it. Wike and his colleagues, their actions after losing the presidential primaries seriously undermined the presidential ambition of Atiku Abubakar and also the chances of the party.        
“So, they are people who have betrayed their party and have now found camp. Wike was a man who described PDP’s problem as malaria and APC’s problem as cancer but has now found himself in a cancerous position.
“As far as I am concerned, I think the PDP has to choose where it wants to be in the history of Nigeria’s politics at this time.
“Does it want to be a strong opposition party that would stand up to the excesses and brigandage and the antics of the APC? Or does it want to be a subordinate of the APC because if those who betrayed or undermined the party are allowed to go scout free, it is encouraging each and every person to do that,” he added.
Sani insisted that an opposition party must distinct it’s position, principle, and stance and also sustain its focus as far as the country is concerned, otherwise, the Labour Party might take the shine off the party and play the role of the real opposition party to the APC.
“PDP has lost power to APC, and it is now losing the role of the opposition to the Labour Party. If you look at what is happening, most of the attacks and counterattacks are coming from the APC and the LP.
“So, it has reached a point that even most members of APC don’t consider PDP as a serious opposition. The PDP has lost power to APC, and it is losing its position of the opposition to the Labour Party and that will be a death sentence for the party if things progress along this line,” Sani declared.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/27222426/Nyesom-Wike.png

NCM, which is an amalgamation of community-based socio-cultural and economically-inclined northern organisations, issued the ulimatum after Otti converted Lokpanta Cattle Market to a daily and non-residential one.
The governor’s decision was viewed as a quit notice to northerners.
The NCM, however, rescinded its order after a meeting the governor had with the leadership of the Umuchieze Cattle Market. 
The group’s President,  Awwal  Aliyu, who led the leadership of the Umuchieze cattle dealers to the meeting at the governor’s residence on Tuesday, announced the decision to withdraw the quit notice.
Aliyu said at the meeting with the governor, they realised that there was no tribal sentiment attached to the state government’s decision.
He declared that Otti means well and is interested in the security and safety of the traders at the cattle market contrary to earlier allegation that he had asked northern residents in the state to leave.      
“I’m using this medium to say that we have cancelled that 14-day ultimatum that was given to easterners,” he declared.
He commended the governor for agreeing to assist the vulnerable members of the northern community in renting accommodation outside the market as well as holding periodic meetings with them on issues concerning their wellbeing.
Aliyu advised  northerners  in the state to be law-abiding, respect constituted authorities, and be good ambassadors of the Northern people, wherever they find themselves.
The governor, while receiving his guests, restated that his interest in making the Umuchieze Cattle Market a daily one is to end the killings, kidnappings and other criminal activities going on in the market.

The governor emphasised that he is a detribalized Nigerian, noting that he does not know about segregation and can never be associated with tribalism.
He stated that the government’s earlier directive was misunderstood and pointed out that the aim of making the market a daily one was to secure the place in the overall interest of traders and residents alike.
Otti said that the meeting convened at his instance was to explain the true position of the government, adding that without security, there would be no development.        
“Anytime we allow religion and ethnicity to play a role in what we are doing, we are missing the point. What I have come to do in governance is to give service to the people.

That was part of submissions at the stakeholders’ meeting on the Building Community Response to Climate Change organised by the Human and Environmental Development Agenda Resource Centre, held in Ogbomoso zone, Oyo State.
They lamented that farmers were not adequately enlightened about the devastating effects of climate change.
One of the participants,  Paul Ojoawo, who spoke with The PUNCH, said, “Aside from the widely reported herders on our farms, the unpredictable climate change is another factor that we are contending. Our farmlands are not yielding the expected produce it used to be. 
“As we all know, the South Western part of the country is an agrarian community but the richness of the land has been washed with erosion occasioned by deforestation.  Related News   
“The previously notable trees such as Iroko, Obeche, and Mahogany have been caught down without replacement thereby exposing the crops to environmental hazards.”
Another participant, Ajibola Benjamin, in her own submission said, “Our annual losses arising from climate change could not be quantified in terms of naira value. The planting and harvesting periods in the past ten years are unpredictable. This has resulted in a decline in productivity.”      
Earlier in his address, the Executive Secretary, HEDA, Sulaimon Arigbabu, urged the farmers to set up accessible and user-friendly reporting channels within their communities.
Arigbabu said, “These include telephone, WhatsApp groups, community meetings or designated reporting centers, educate the community members about the types of climate-related incidences. You should clearly communicate the process for reporting climate-related incidents. Make sure everyone understands what information is needed and how it should be conveyed.
“Involve community leaders, health workers, and volunteers in the reporting process. They can act as intermediaries between community members and local authority.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/28104858/women-farmers.jpg

•President endorses tax reforms, panel to address FEC, FIRS pledges implementation
In a move to eliminate multiple taxation, the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms has proposed the stoppage of 190 taxes choking businesses in the country.
The panel presented its ‘Quick Win Report’ to President Bola Tinubu, who endorsed its far-reaching recommendations on tax and fiscal policies during a brief ceremony at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Tuesday. 
The Organised Private Sector, which backed the proposal of the committees blamed states for multiple taxation in the country.
The OPS lamented that multiple taxes had compounded the rising production costs, leading to reduced profit margins, supply chain disruptions, and a reduction in consumer spending.
Specifically, the telecommunication operators complained that the sector was one of the most taxed in the country with over 40 taxes directed at telecom firms.      
The Head of Operations, Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria, Gbolahan Awonuga, said the problem of multiple taxes was caused by the state governments.
In response to the toxic business environment, the President inaugurated the fiscal policy and tax reforms in August which was tasked with improving the nation’s revenue profile and business environment.
The Chairman of the committee, Mr Taiwo Oyedele, while presenting his report to the President said the panel suggested the merger of over 200 taxes being paid by Nigerian businesses into 10.
In his prayers to the President, Oyedele, among others, called for an emergency economic intervention bill (Executive Bill) and the issuance of Presidential Executive Orders to address the duplication of functions across the public service, and to ensure prudent public financial management in a bid to optimize value from government assets and natural resources.
 Responding to the committee’s presentation, the President commended their work and assured them of his support for the review and implementation of key recommendations.
‘’I have listened attentively to your report. Charting the critical path forward for Nigeria’s economic recovery is crucial to all of us. I want to say thank you to your delegation,’’ he said.
Tinubu granted the request of the committee to address a meeting of the Federal Executive Council and apprise cabinet members of their work and the expected outcomes to facilitate economic growth.        
A statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Ajuri Ngelale, disclosed that the President directed his Special Adviser on Policy Coordination, Ms. Hadiza Bala Usman, to coordinate with the relevant government officials for the session.
FIRS pledges implementation
In his remarks, the acting Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service, Mr Zacch Adedeji, pledged to ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the committee, as they may apply, pending the approval of the President.
Adedeji declared that beyond supporting the fiscal and tax reforms, the FIRS would explore opportunities to diversify the nation’s revenue sources, as the historical over-reliance on oil has made the economy vulnerable.
He noted, ‘’Nigeria’s fiscal policy serves as the foundation of economic stability. It dictates how the government collects, manages, and allocates resources for the betterment of our people. A well-developed fiscal policy is crucial for the provision of infrastructure, healthcare, education, and social services to our growing population. Tax reforms are an integral part of a robust fiscal policy.’’
Addressing State House correspondents at a briefing attended by Adedeji and Ngelale, Oyedele argued that multiple taxation had shrunk the Federal Government’s internally generated revenue pool as opposed to increasing it.  Related News   Kaduna ex-senator, Sani,  opens up on Wike  I never promised Tinubu unconditional support- Dele Momodu tells APC  Tinubu lauds Ooni of Ife at 49   
“We have over 60 taxes and levies, officially collectible by federal, state and local governments. Unofficially, those taxes are over 200, making life difficult for our people. So the taxes at all levels of government combined, we think, should be less than 10,” he stated.      
Giving a rundown of the committee’s activities in the past two months, he explained, “We have been speaking to the various policymakers from the central bank leadership, to the finance minister who is also the coordinating Minister for the Economy, the FIRS and the Joint Task Board, and even to state governors.
“We also had sessions with the Senate. So, we have been actively engaging with various key stakeholders, trying to put the framework in place for implementing our recommendations.
“All we need to do is to formally present the report to Mr. President, but I will say that once we get the nod from Mr. President, it will be like this switching on the tap and then the implementation starts immediately.”
The tax expert cited instances where his team discovered that sachet water sellers were paying seven taxes daily.
“Why should someone who is just trying to hawk pure water to keep body and soul together have to pay seven taxes on a daily basis?” he queried.
“It doesn’t make a lot of sense to us. So, now we are in that phase of rewriting our laws. We spent time with the Senate and we would also do the same with the House of Representatives.
The former Africa Tax Leader at PriceWaterhouseCoopers said his committee would continue public consultation and stakeholder engagement till November 15, saying, “We have received input from every single state in Nigeria and we’re just starting.”  
He said such efforts are crucial to the reform process, whose end results would increase Nigerians’ employability in the global gig economy.
“The most sustainable way for any country to generate revenue is to grow the economy. When businesses succeed, when individuals prosper, they pay taxes. For us, that’s the most fundamental.
“So, we’re looking at how we can remove the impediments to businesses, to trade…think about young Nigerians, many of them very smart and intelligent. But today, we have legal and tax impediments that will not allow global organisations to hire Nigerians in Nigeria to work within the global value system.
“So we’ll remove those impediments so that people can then gain employment, earn dollars while they are here in Nigeria, which not only helps with our foreign exchange management, but shows that people also have prosperity to lift themselves and their families from poverty, and of course, they will pay taxes on their income to the government,” Oyedele further explained.
ALTON backs panel
Commenting on the development by the Federal Government, the Head of Operations, ALTON,  Awonuga, said removing multiple taxes would ensure the smooth operation of the telecom sector.
He told The PUNCH, “We don’t know, but we recently submitted a position paper to the Federal Government. Most of these problems of multiple taxes are from the state governments though. However, we believe that the actions of the tax committee will ripple to it and impact us.’’      
“Removing the multiple taxes aimed at us will create a free flow of operations and will ensure that we do not implement the variation tariff (different telecom rates across states) we are currently pushing for,” Awonuga explained.
A facilitator with the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, Dr Ikenna Nwaosu, commended the planned elimination of over-taxation but observed that the committee needed to clarify the details of the taxes it sought to end.
 Also, the Chief Executive Officer of Economic Associates, Dr Ayo Teriba, said, “It will be nice to know what the 10 taxes are. It is one thing to say that we are going to reduce the number of taxes and we are going to end up with 10.
“It is good that we do away with the multiplicity of taxes. Ten sounds like it is fewer than 200 but it is a lot still. What are these taxes? What are the rates? And the sum total of their effects? The fact that they have reduced may imply that their burden may be reduced but that it may also not imply that the burden will reduce.
“So, it sounds good that we are going to eliminate these taxes. It will be nice to see the shortlist. Also, is it federal or the federation that you will not pay more than 10 types of taxes across federal, state, and local governments? It will be good news,” Teriba stated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/25003419/Presidential-Committee-on-Fiscal-Policy-and-Tax-Reforms.jpg

“By virtue of the provision of Section 287 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), the commission is bound to enforce the orders of the court on the nomination of candidates by political parties in the state.
“The amended list of candidates in respect of the 2023 Imo State Governorship election is hereby amended pursuant to the orders of court served on the Commission,” Oriaran-Anthony said.        
The Federal High Court, Abuja, on October 10, disqualified Sylva from participating in the state governorship election.
Justice Donatus Okorowo, in the judgment, ruled that Sylva having been sworn in twice and ruled for five years as the Bayelsa State governor, would breach the 1999 constitution as amended if allowed to contest again.
The judge also declared that Sylva was not qualified to run in the November poll because if he won and was sworn in, he would spend more than eight years in office as governor of the state.
Also the Federal High Court, Owerri judicial division, in Suit No. FHC/OW/CS/35/2023 – PRP & Anor v. INEC, amongst others, equally ordered INEC to include the name of the PRP governorship candidate in the list of nominated candidates already published on the INEC website.

The deceased’s friend in a chat with our correspondent on X via @michaelojuola on Tuesday disclosed that the suspects’ photos and information had been “sent to all the airports around so they don’t escape, they are still searching for them.”
According to the X user on Sunday, Chibuikem was allegedly murdered by a group of Chinese. He disclosed that the deceased died of alleged torture by his assailants who tied his hands and mouth and subsequently beat him to death.
He said the incident happened at Orlacson Street, 6014, Mandaue City, Philippines. He further disclosed to our correspondent that the issue began around October 19 and was premised upon a demand for commission for Chibuikem’s girlfriend who is a Philippine. 
“There was a heated argument among the deceased, his girlfriend and the head of the company who happens to be a Chinese woman. The argument was because of the commission Chibuikem’s girlfriend was supposed to get,” the friend told PUNCH Metro.
According to him, the matter later degenerated when two vehicles came to the premises and the occupants took Chibuikem away claiming they were taking him to the police station for constituting a nuisance. It was later discovered by the deceased’s allies that Chibuikem was not taken to the station. According to his friend, a bus later came to drop the student off in front of the police station with his hands tied and scars on his face.
Chibuikem was later pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, he further disclosed.

When contacted on Tuesday, Abdur-Rahman said the commission would only rely on information it got from the Nigerian embassy in the Philippines and that of the complainant to aid its investigation, adding, “So, we’re still investigating.”
The National Association of Nigerian Students also demanded justice for the deceased.
PUNCH Metro learnt on Tuesday that the Mandaue City Police Office had filed cases of murder against the six Chinese nationals, who allegedly killed the Nigerian, who died on October 21, a Philippines-based media outfit, Cebu Daily News, reported.
Police Lieutenant Colonel Franco Oriol, who is the MCPO deputy city director for administration and spokesperson, said they were able to identify four of the six Chinese allegedly involved and murder cases were filed against them.
“According to the witness, the Nigerian national refused to work there on the job that he was given, and the Chinese allegedly suspected him of sexually harassing one of their co-workers. According to our witnesses, the Nigerian was mauled in the other room,” the CDN quoted the police spokesperson as saying.        
It was however learnt that the deceased’s girlfriend strongly denied the allegation.
The police said they were still verifying the accusation of the Chinese. There is also a possibility that it was just the cover-up of their mauling, he said, according to CDN.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/23000924/Medic-student-killed.jpg

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Omolola   Odutola, said this on Tuesday while speaking during an interview on Secure365, a radio programme initiated by the state police command.
She advised road users to be alert and make safety on the road a part of their lifestyle.
“I also need our motorists to drive for others and be cautious because some vehicle brakes are not working properly. I want you to be careful while driving and avoid speeding. 
“Do not always assume you are cautious while driving. Always make sure your car parts are in good condition before you get on the wheel, and do not drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs,” she cautioned motorists.
Omolola noted that no fewer than 10 auto accidents had occurred in Ogun State in the last eight days, in which some of them were fatal while some had the victims left with serious fractures and bodily injuries.
She also advised motorists and commuters to be security conscious this ember period, as anyone could be a prey to evil perpetrators.      
“We have had cases of people who act as passengers, so they can snatch the motorcycle of a commercial cyclist.

“Criminals and hoodlums use taxis and buses to stage ‘one chance’ vehicles, so before you board any public transit, observe the passengers and take a mental capture. If your intuition doesn’t permit you to hop in, wait for the next vehicle.”
She also pleaded with the public to implore safety measures while on motorcycles because of possible accidents that may occur.
“When you are riding on a motorcycle, your body is the cover of the motorcycle, and you need to be careful.
“Most people don’t wear their crash helmet while on a motorcycle, even when it is at an uncontrollable speed. The Nigeria Police Force needs you alive, and we want you to celebrate this ember month without any fracture, injury, or mourning,” she said.
When asked about the reason the law guiding the compulsory use of helmets by commercial motorcyclists ceased taking effect, Omolola said the road users frustrated their effort.
“ If you wear your helmet, you are safer and if you don’t wear your helmet, you are likely to crash. Sometimes, it is not as if the law enforcement agencies overlook some of these things but when we come so hard on these commercial motorcycles, you begin to hear false stories about us.        
“As passengers, learn to be safe by insisting that the motorcycle rider provides a crash helmet for you,” Omolola added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14205929/A-NIGERIAN-POLICE-OFFICER.jpg

The judge held that the prosecution proved the two counts charge of defilement and sexual assault by penetration against Olaleye.
He stated that the evidence that was presented before the court, against the convict, was compelling and proven beyond reasonable doubt.
In his judgment, Oshodi held that Olaleye’s confessional statement which he made before his former counsel, Mr. Olalekan Buruji, and the Divisional Police Officer of Anthony Police Station, Patricia Amadi, when he stated that he regretted his action, proved that he committed the offences. 
The judge also held that Olaleye denying an undertaking made at the police station did not hold water, as the document that he signed had his counsel, Buruji’s NBA seal, on it.
“The convict is a dangerous offender who should be ashamed of himself as he did not show any sign of remorse.
“The convict began to groom the survivor during the COVID-19 lockdown. The survivor, to your knowledge, was a child but you forced her to watch pornography, rub her breast, and put your penis in her mouth and ejaculated in her mouth.      
“You penetrated her and there was blood in which you did it repeatedly. You acknowledged that you are a sex addict in your confession but came to this court and told lies. You showed no remorse and it shows that you are a dangerous man to society, who should be locked away from the people,” the judge said.
Justice Oshodi thereafter found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment each on the two counts which he said would run concurrently.
Before the judge handed down the verdict, the convict’s counsel, Mr. Adebisi Oridate, in his plea for mercy pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy.
He said, “The convict was a first-time offender who offered public service and had cancer patients to care for.
“He is a medical doctor who offers services to people who suffer from cancer-related ailments, especially women from Lagos State and Nigeria.
“The state recognised his services and the convict has lost his business because he has been incarcerated and he has lost his family. He has lost his means of livelihood and he has an aged mother who is solely dependent on him but we pray your Lordship to temper justice with mercy.”  Related News   
In his response, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Dr. Babajide Martins, prayed the court to sentence him on a mandatory sentencing as maintained by the law of Lagos State.        
Martins said, “We urge the court to give the convict a mandatory sentence and also have his name registered in the sexual offences register as maintained by Lagos State.”
He said the prosecution had proved that he sexually assaulted the survivor by penetrating her vagina, releasing sperm into her mouth with his penis for about 19 months until the wife discovered and reported it to the police.
During the trial, 10 witnesses were called who testified against the defendant while the defence called three witnesses.
While pronouncing the sentence, the judge held that, “By the laws of Lagos State, I am compelled to hand you a sentence of life imprisonment on each count of your offence.
“But your defence counsel has said that you are a first-time offender and that you are a doctor of cancer patients who is in partnership with Lagos State.
“I hereby sentence you to life imprisonment on both counts one and two of defilement and sexual assault by penetration, which should run concurrently.
“The convict’s name should be registered in the Sexual Offenders Register as maintained by Lagos State Government,” the judge held.      
Meanwhile, popular Nollywood actress, Kate Henshaw, who was an advocate under Olaleye’s cancer foundation, while reacting to the judgment said it was a joyous day.
Henshaw who was also amongst the first voices that came out against Olaleye when he was accused of raping his wife’s niece, said the judgment day was a day that she would forever remember.
“It is a day that I will forever remember, it is a day that has been enforced in me that when you find a righteous judge when you find that you are in a system that is functional irrespective of bribery and corruption, because even before this judgment was delivered, he was still trying to bribe the girl, he picked her up sent her mother and her self money trying to divert and pervert the cause of justice, it didn’t work.
“They refunded the money he paid to them to him. Thank you, the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence. I have always given them kudos. If that’s the only thing that Lagos does, I will stand with them. Thank you to Mirabel Centre, and all the organisations that helped,” she said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/24142229/Dr-Olaleye-e1698153749615.jpeg

This is just as some residents claimed that no fewer than seven persons died in the accident.
The boat conveying mainly women and children was said to have run out of fuel after a passenger alighted in one of the settlements in the riverine communities.
The boat was said to have drifted away from its route and collided with the barges. 
When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Chidi Nwabuzor, confirmed the accident, saying that only one person died in the mishap.
“Marine police confirmed that one person died and four others were injured while others were rescued unhurt,” Nwabuzor said.
The council’s Vice Chairman, Blessing Perewari, who visited the scene of the incident, sympathised with the families of the victims and said the dead had been deposited at the mortuary.      
He said, “From what I heard, about 28 adults, two pregnant women and three babies were involved. When they got to the Gelegele waterside, there were oil barges that were parked in parallel.

“The barges were parked in a way that they obstructed the waterway. So, this particular boat carrying 28 persons, after dropping two passengers, tried to restart the boat but the engine failed to respond.
“Because of the high current of the river, it pushed the boat into the barges and it torpedoed under the barges making it difficult for the victims to come out. Some of them that could swim managed to escape while others were trapped under the barges.
“With the help of the Marine Police and other community members, we were able to rescue 18 of the passengers and seven died.”
Perewari blamed the oil company for its inability to provide ambulances to convey the dead.
However, a senior staff member of the company, who is not authorised to speak on the issue, said, “Our barges and tug boat were anchored at our jetty and that day incidentally was Ekheuan market day. If you have been to our jetty before, we have three barges that are normally there, they have been there before 1987 and that was not the only boat that passed through that place that day.
“The police were involved in the rescue operations and they know everything that happened. The Army speedboat was also close by and witnessed all that happened.        
“The community chairman works for the company that owns the barges. He was there just for his routine inspection when the incident occurred.

One of them, identified simply as Akande, said, “The water at some point covered up some of our blocks, but it is gradually reducing because we are at the tail end of the water flow. But many vehicles we use for our work and those parked by others have been submerged.”
 A resident of Isheri Riverview, Tunde Adebanjo, said, “The water is often released like this every year and we suffer the consequences. I only came here to check if the water had gone down, but there was no positive sign at all. We have moved temporarily to a place in Lagos.”      
Our correspondent also observed that the Mikano company along the highway had its frontage and compound flooded. Efforts to get close to the building to hear from the workers proved abortive as the water surrounded the premises. While one or two persons were seen in the compound from afar, other passersby said activities in the company were affected.
Meanwhile, the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Monday declared a state of emergency in the flooded area as he assured residents of quick intervention.

The governor spoke with journalists after inspecting the flooded community, saying that his administration is working with the Federal Government to deal with the situation as an emergency case.
The governor said, “We will prioritise the works here because I am touched with what I have seen. I will ensure that we immediately begin to see signs of relief as we step this up. The Minister of State for Environment is already aware. The Vice President is already aware and also the President. It will be dealt with as an emergency and we are taking it as such.
“As an emergency, I would like to take it up myself. Please continue to bear with us as we are going to conduct a comprehensive assessment of what we need to do to make this place conducive for living.”
Addressing residents of Riverview Estate, Abiodun said he had requested an area survey of the estate to identify critical areas that needed immediate intervention.
He assured that the intervention would come through the construction of an elevated road with adequate drainages to mitigate their suffering.        
The governor described the environment around the Kara cattle market as an eyesore and not befitting the dreams of a “new Ogun State.”
He said that the market was not conducive to human living and not in tandem with the Sustainable Development Goals and waste disposal.
The Chairman, Riverview Estate, Abayomi Akande, in his remarks, intimated the governor about the suffering residents of the area are going through as a result of the flooding.
He said there was a need for a panel of inquiry into the operations of Oyan Dam to stop the incessant release of water to cause havoc in the state.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/23224954/A-flooded-area-along-the-expressway.jpg

This is just as the National Association of Nigerian Students has demanded justice for the deceased.
 On Sunday, an X user, @michaelojuola, tweeted that the deceased’s hands were tied, his mouth covered and he was beaten to death allegedly by a group of Chinese.
 The tweep called on NiDCOM and the Nigerian Senate among others, to intervene. 
 Reacting in a statement on Monday, the NiDCOM spokesperson, Abdur-Rahman Balogun, said the commission would set machinery in motion to investigate the matter
 “Though the matter had not been officially reported to the Nigerian Embassy in the Philippines, NiDCOM has asked the ‘eyewitness’ who posted the gory incident on his social media handle to provide more details to the commission’s e-mail —[email protected].

 “The commission will set the machinery in motion to investigate the matter and unravel the circumstances surrounding the incident,” the spokesperson said.      
 Meanwhile, NANS has demanded justice for the deceased.
 The Senate Deputy President of NANS, Elvis Ekudina, described the act as “wickedness and one not to be overlooked.”
 NANS disclosed that it had received “confirmation from students in the Diaspora” that “the deceased, a Nigerian medical student named Ikem, was allegedly murdered in the Philippines by a group of Chinese.”
 NANS called on the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “to look into the situation and make sure that justice is done as this seems to be another xenophobic attack against Nigerians.
 “This is inhumane, and cannot be accepted by the leadership of Nigerian students. We also seek that on the account of the Chinese government, the murdered student should be given last respect by ensuring that his corpse is flown back to Nigeria to ensure he gets a befitting burial.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/23000924/Medic-student-killed.jpg

The residents who spoke to PUNCH Metro lamented that since the hotel began operation in the residential area last year, they no longer sleep well due to the noise which they said usually begins late in the evening into the early hours of the morning.
The residents said they had petitioned the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency many times without a respite and they later resorted to sending a petition through a law firm.
One of the residents, Mr Leonard Onyibe, told our correspondent that they had met with the managers of the hotel and yet, the situation remains the same. 
 “The sound is crazy, it is killing. The first time the noise pollution started was the week the hotel was opened and it was so scary. That was sometime last year.
“We reached out to the hotel to complain and the manager was so apologetic but nothing happened. We cannot even sleep. We go to work and come back to unbearable noise, no rest,” Onyibe said.
According to LASEPA’s Noise Control Guidelines, the standard approved noise level in residential areas shall not exceed 55 decibels during the day and 45 decibels at night but Onyibe said noise from the hotel reaches “more than 90 decibels, (90 decibels is a high noise level, equivalent to the sound level of a concert.) The noise pollution is bad enough.”        Related News   Residents tackle developer of 10-storey  hotel, Lagos seals property  Residents protest demolition in Ogun community  Residents groan as downpour leaves Lagos flooded, properties destroyed   
Another resident, Seyi Runsewe, also said, “The noise that the hotel causes is terrible. At night, my family cannot sleep because there’s loud music playing between 2am and 3am. This is not fair at all.”
When our correspondent visited the area around 8.30pm on Saturday, she noticed that a party was ongoing in the hotel with loud music that could be heard from four houses away.
However, the hotel’s manager, Dorothy Ewa, denied the allegation that the hotel caused noise pollution within the area.
“We do not cause any noise pollution in the area. When we play band, it is not regularly, we have a time frame to it, and it doesn’t get into the night like the neighbours reported,” Ewa said.
LASEPA’s Public Relations Officer, Mrs Bola Ajao, was not reachable on the telephone.

Our correspondent, who was in the area on Saturday, saw the seal of the ministry on the two entrances of the property which is still under construction.
The notice read that the owner of the property had contravened some sections of the state environmental laws, stating, “You’re to abate the nuisance and pay stipulated fines” into the state government account before reopening.
PUNCH Metro gathered that residents of the area had in a letter dated October 9, 2023, petitioned the Lagos State Building Control Agency, alleging that a proposed 10-storey hotel building was being constructed within the residential vicinity and would be of inconvenience to the residents. 
The letter was signed by the residents, Bodunrin Adebimpe, Tony Aruede, Kenneth Odusanya, Basorun and a representative of a Celestial Church of Christ in the area, Ajayi Omonehin.
They claimed that the construction on the road outside the land space of the developer’s property had disfigured the close and was creating difficulties for vehicular movement.
They also alleged that the ongoing construction is posing a security risk because the mini gate at the close’s end of the site office is normally opened at the same time as the gate at the expressway, thereby making the close accessible from the expressway to hoodlums.      
“It is our considered opinion that a 10-storey building is a project that must be handled with caution and the highest level of professionalism with proper consideration for the wellness and interest of the neighbours particularly in a residential community,” they concluded.

Speaking with PUNCH Metro, the property’s developer, Wakeel Olohunfemi, said the matter was being handled by the state Ministry of Environment.
“The case is at the state Ministry of Environment,” Wakeel simply said.
The spokesperson for the ministry, Kunle Adeshina, urged the residents to be patient with the government.
Adeshina said, “There are different enforcement units in the ministry. If the ministry has come to seal it, maybe the complaints they (the residents) made were official, and that’s why they’ve gone there. There are procedures. It’s not that they would go there today and demolish.
 “If the building is on infractions, every due process must be explored before punitive action can be taken. So, they should just exercise patience. The processes are meant to be exhausted.”
Another notice by LASBCA was seen on the gate of the building with the caption “Under Inspection.”        
A source in LASBCA however said the proposed building got approval from the physical planning agency of the state government.
“The proposed building has approval, but the complaints will be promptly investigated,” the official who asked not to be named said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/23000928/gat-of-sealed-0-storey-building.jpg

The crash occurred in the eastern city of Bhairab when a freight train smashed into a passenger train travelling in the opposite direction, derailing two passenger carriages, officials said.
A government administrator in Bhairab, Sadiqur Rahman said, “We have recovered 15 bodies, many are injured. 
“The death toll will rise,” Rahman said, with rescuers reporting they could still see bodies crushed and trapped under overturned coaches.
“At least 100 people were injured. The accident, which took place at around 4:00 pm (1000 GMT), occurred when one train entered the same line as the other,” he added.
Train accidents are common in Bangladesh and are often caused by poor signaling, negligence, old tracks or other rundown infrastructure.

Robertson sustained the damage in a collision with Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon during Scotland’s Euro 2024 qualifying defeat earlier in October.
The left-back, who has played eight league games and scored one goal for Liverpool this season, was replaced by Kostas Tsimikas for last Saturday’s Merseyside derby win against Everton.
He faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines and Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was unable to pin-point an exact date for his return to action.


  
“Robbo had surgery and all went well, as good as it could be, so the recovery starts after he wakes up,” Klopp told reporters on Wednesday.
“I think it happened this morning. That’s it. We don’t know how long it will take or whatever, but the first step is done, that’s good.
Klopp could make widespread changes for the visit of Toulouse to Anfield in Europa League Group E on Thursday.      
But Klopp does not intend to take the French side for granted despite their limited European pedigree.
“Toulouse deserve all our respect. It is a really interesting story, winning the (French) Cup last year,” he said.

“It was a massive thing. They are a young team, a talented team, you see them playing really nice football and they have a clear idea.
“They got a point against PSG and it was a massive one so we have to make sure we are really ready. Then it is about us. We have to create an atmosphere through the way we play.”
Liverpool would go five points clear in the group with a win, leaving them firmly on track for the knockout stages.
“We want to win football games and this is the next opportunity,” Klopp said.
“A win would bring us to nine points with Toulouse on four, but knowing that changes nothing. We have to play our best. We will make a few changes but not too much.        
“The boys have shown they are really ready for the competition. That’s what I wanted to see.”
Cody Gakpo could return for Liverpool after the Dutch forward recovered from a knee injury sustained in the 2-1 defeat at Tottenham in September.
“Cody is in full training now since Sunday, which means he is available for the squad. Whatever we do with that we will have to see, but that’s good as well,” Klopp said.

Weah, now President of Liberia, was named the best player in the world in 1995, 14 years before the birth of the youngster and he remains the only African footballer to have won the Ballon d’Or or FIFA award till date.
If Solanke’s words are anything to go by, that sole honour held by Weah is now under threat after the kid confidently said he could bring the coveted honour to Nigeria and Africa.
The young striker, who wears jersey No.55 and plays in the No.9 position disclosed that he adores Lionel Messi for his uability to outwit opponents, Neymar Jr for his brilliance and flair, and of course, Cristiano Ronaldo for his strength, pace, discipline and hard work.


  
“I love Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar. And like Ronaldo and Messi, I want to win the Ballon d’Or. My dad told me George Weah of Liberia is the only African footballer to have won the Ballon d’Or.
“Like my idols Messi and Ronaldo, I believe that with more hard work, discipline, perseverance, dedication and focus, I can bring home the honour in the nearest future,” Solanke said.
Solanke fondly called ‘NIMI’, who turned 14 in August, presently plays with the first team of Ogun State-based NLO 1 side, Olumo United, a team he joined at 11.        Related News   
He is one of the most exciting football kids in Lagos and has taken his unbelievable football skills and goal scoring prowess to Ogun State, where he has converted many football fans to his growing fan base.
Speaking on the journey of Solanke in football, his father and founder of Football Academy Provazios, Segun Solanke, revealed that he enrolled him in the academy at the age of four, and since then, the teenager’s young career has been enjoying tremendous growth and progress.
“NIMI’s strengths are his ability to use both legs, his setpiece techniques and unbelievable goals scoring ability. Therefore, we decided to register him to play in the league as we believe it’s the right exposure and experience for him to build on. He pursues his career in football, while he aims to be a global star of the game soon.
“In the next five years, we believe he would have become the youngest Nigerian to play for the Super Eagles and also playing in one of the topflight leagues around the world. And particularly, for Real Madrid, as the wonder boy from Nigeria,” Segun said.
In Solanke’s story, there is inspiration for all aspiring footballers, a reminder that age is no barrier to dreams and that with the right mix of talent, hard work, and determination, the future is boundless.
The journey has only just begun for this young prodigy, and as he continues to take each step, only time will tell if the future holds the realisation of a dream that is as audacious as it is admirable – the dream of a second Ballon d’Or winner from Africa.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/24212940/Patrick-Solanke.jpg

Two-time African champions Enyimba and the Moroccans clash in the reverse fixture on Thursday at the Stade Mohamed V in Casablanca, after the Confederation of Africa Football on Tuesday announced a change in the date earlier scheduled for Wednesday (today).
Enyimba lost the first-leg 1-0 at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo on Sunday and know they must go to Morocco to pick a win to stand a chance of going through to the semi-finals.
Finidi, who also doubles as the Super Eagles assistant coach, blamed his side’s failure to convert their chances for the defeat to Wydad.


  
The only goal of the match came from a first-half penalty, with Yahya Jabrane expertly converting from the spot past Enyimba captain and goalkeeper, Ojo Olorunleke, in the 39th minute.
The two-time African champions had several chances to equalise and even win the game but wasted the opportunities presented to them to win the game.
Speaking ahead of the clash, Finidi, while lamenting their wasted opportunities, remained optimistic.      
 “Football is about goal scoring; if we had scored, the overall result would have been different,” Finidi said on Brila FM.  Related News   AFL: Enyimba under fire over handwritten jersey number  CAF celebrates retired Oparanozie  Lawsuit brews as CAF cancels AFCON TV broadcast deal   
“In a couple of days, we will have the return leg. I’m happy that in as much as we want to win the game, I’m happy that we lost by just 1-0, which gives us another opportunity to go over there and see if we can.
“If we have the same opportunities that we got here, if we can take one or two it’s going to be a different ball game.”
“I’m quite optimistic about the second leg, but it’s unfortunate that we lost the first leg.
Meanwhile, Wydad head coach Ramzi has warned his side against complacency.
“It’s a match with two periods,” Ramzi said, as per Le Martin.
“I’m happy with today’s result, especially since we scored and didn’t concede.        
“Enyimba is a good team and we will have to concentrate in Casablanca during the return match. Matches only end with the referee’s whistle.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20214223/FINIDI.jpg
sports,Osayi-Samuel: Silent operator leading Fener’s title charge,"The adage that strikers win matches and that defenders win leagues, seems to be losing its potency with every passing season in the world of football. Defensive players are often misunderstood by fans...","<span class=""post-date"">25th October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/osayi-samuel-silent-operator-leading-feners-title-charge/,  Ebenezer Bajela,"The adage that strikers win matches and that defenders win leagues, seems to be losing its potency with every passing season in the world of football.
Defensive players are often misunderstood by fans, coaches and managers alike.
They often get much of the blame when their teams end up on the losing side but they are hardly commended for their efforts when they keep clean sheets or even score a goal.
While they often don’t get the applause they deserve, their importance to the team cannot be overemphasised because they do the nuts and bolts parts of the game without fuss.


  
Their defensive qualities like positional play, marking and organisational skills often attract less attention from the untrained eye.
That is the case of Super Eagles and Fenerbahce defender Bright Osayi-Samuel.
The 25-year-old is not the kind of player who often makes the headlines but effortlessly gets the job done on the field of play.      
Apart from his defensive duties, the right-back has been impressive in front of goal this season and on Sunday scored his third league goal of the season.
The Okija-born player, who is enjoying one of his best moments as a player under manager Ismail Kartal in the Turkish topflight, scored the second goal in Fenerbahce’s 4-2 win over Hatayspor at the Ulker Stadyumu Fenerbahce Sukru Saracoglu Spor Kompleksi.
Osayi-Samuel’s impressive form is one of the reasons Fenerbahce boast a 100 per cent win in Europe and currently sit top of the Super Lig with nine wins from as many games. But he does his job without attracting any attention to himself; preferring instead to do the yeoman’s job in a quiet manner on the pitch, rather than grab the headlines on the cover of the next day’s dailies.
The energetic defender has contributed 12.5 per cent of the 24 goals scored by the Yellow Canaries so far this season.
According to findings by our correspondent, no defender has scored more goals than Osayi-Samuel across the Top 5 European leagues.
Paris Saint-Germain’s Achraf Hakimi is the only defender to have scored the same number of goals with the Nigerian.
Apart from his goal scoring exploits, he has also contributed three assists for Fenerbahce.        
While enjoying his rich form in front of goal, the 25-year-old has also quietly carried on with his primary duty helping his side to the second-joint best defensive record in Europe.
Only OGC Nice in the French league have conceded fewer goals (4) than Fenerbahce.  Related News   Rashidi Yekini@60: 12 things to know about the late ‘goalsfather’  ‘It’ll be difficult convincing Atubolu to join Eagles’  Eagles players begged me to stay – Peseiro   
The Super Lig leaders alongside Serie A giants Inter Milan have only conceded five goals so far this campaign.
Why the knack for goal scoring?
The Nigeria international started his career as a pure winger who delighted in taking on his markers with his pace, trickery, and guile, little wonder his style of play as a full-back is quite reminiscent of Victor Moses in Antonio Conte’s 2016/17 English Premier League-winning squad.
Born in Okija, Anambra State, Osayi-Samuel moved to Spain at an early age before emigrating to England at 10 years of age. A product of the Blackpool academy, he broke into the first team as a teenager in 2015, playing primarily as a winger across League One, League Two and very briefly in the Championship before securing a move to Championship mainstays Queen Park Rangers in September 2017.  His ability to dribble, create and pose a threat to opposition defences was never in doubt but the numbers have hardly been really outstanding in terms of goals and assists for the Fenerbaçhe man.
Thirty-seven goals and assists in 194 appearances across the lower divisions of English football may have looked more average than world-class but it was his potential that had most likely attracted Fenerbaçhe to him as he switched to the Turkish giants in the second half of the 2020/21 season and it was just a goal and an assist to his name in a total of 19 appearances before the end of that season.      
His first full season he was only able to manage two goals and five assists in 43 appearances across all competitions. Though, the arrival of Portuguese manager, Vítor Pereira, at Fenerbaçhe in the summer of 2021 occasioned a formation change to a 3-4-3 for the Turkish club with Osayi-Samuel being one of those affected by this tweak as he was made to be the right wing-back in Pereira’s new set-up.
 “That’s not usually my position, I’ve been an out-and-out winger. He wanted me to come back as a full-back when we didn’t have the ball. He started teaching me the basics of defending, and from there I started playing as a wing-back,” Osayi-Samuel said in an interview.
He 25-year-old continued being a wing-back/full-back from then on, and following a decent 2022/23 season where he established himself as a key player for Fenerbaçhe, the Nigerian will be hoping for a big 2023/23 season. Analysing full-backs and wing-backs in modern-day football is hardly done without taking a glossary look into the attacking outputs as it is these attacking numbers that have made full-backs like Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Achraf Hakimi and Andrew Robertson amongst others stand out.
If there’s another area Osayi-Samuel has excelled at so far during his time career, it’s his coordination.
He may not possess the dribbling skills of Brazil’s Marcelo or the powerful shot of Roberto Carlos but he sure possesses a gifted physique that allows him to beat his opponents in one-on-one duels and often time he did that to perfection without committing much fouls.
Evidence of his clean tackling is the fact that he had only been booked once in the league from his six appearances this season. Again, Osayi-Samuel has never been shown a red card in his entire career, a rare achievement for a defender.
In his 115 appearances during his stint with Queens Park Rangers, Osayi-Samuel scored 13 goals plus another 13 assists.  
Strong, quick, and athletic, Osayi-Samuel possesses the qualities of a modern-day full-back/wing-back, but it was not until less than a year ago that the 25-year-old made his first appearance for the Super Eagles on November 17, playing 90 minutes in a pre-tournament friendly against Portugal, who, unlike Nigeria, were preparing to play in the World Cup. Nigeria lost 4-0, but Osayi-Samuel was arguably their strongest performer, holding his own on the right flank and even winning a penalty that could have seen them cut the deficit to one goal, only for Emmanuel Dennis to squander the opportunity from the spot.
There is no doubt that Osayi-Samuel possesses the kind of talent that interests the lovers of the game and earlier this summer, there were rumours linking the Blackpool academy graduate with a move away from Turkey, but instead, he has remained put in Istanbul, and he looks set to play a key role in defence for a Fener side that has enjoyed a strong start to life under İsmail Kartal, who won two league titles as a player and two as an assistant manager with Fener — their two most recent — and who has taken charge of the club for a third time.
And if he continues with this form, the smooth but silent operator is surely destined for the top.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/22020641/Osayi-Samuel.jpg

The ...","<span class=""post-date"">24th October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/champions-league-gabriel-jesus-steers-arsenal-to-win-over-sevilla/,Agency Report,"Gabriel Jesus scored a sublime goal and created another to earn Arsenal an important 2-1 Champions League win over Sevilla on Tuesday, making up for their shock defeat at Lens earlier in October.
The Brazilian striker crafted Gabriel Martinelli’s opener with a masterful turn and pass and then doubled the Gunners’ lead with a lethal finish, as Mikel Arteta’s side moved top of Group B.
Arsenal moved up to six points, one ahead of Lens, with the French side drawing 1-1 at home against PSV Eindhoven, who are level on two points with Sevilla.
Diego Alonso’s team put up a spirited showing in the Uruguayan’s second match in charge, following their impressive and intense performance in a draw against La Liga leaders Real Madrid on Saturday.


  
However, Arsenal had more cutting edge in attack and Jesus’ quality made the difference in an entertaining clash in Andalusia — he has scored in each of his team’s matches in the competition.
Sevilla boasted before kick-off with banners hailing their record seven Europa League triumphs, but in the heart of their defence they also have a four-time Champions League winner in Sergio Ramos.
The 37-year-old martialled the defence well as the hosts kept Arteta’s side at bay for the majority of the first half, which was bookended by Martinelli chances.      
Sevilla goalkeeper Orjan Nyland saved the first, darting off his line quickly to deflect Martinelli’s shot back off the striker and out for a goal kick.
The hosts took control in driving rain at the rowdy Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium, with Lucas Ocampos flicking wide and Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya looking uncertain under pressure, giving the ball away on multiple occasions.
Arteta defended the Spain international after he made two mistakes in Saturday’s Premier League draw at Chelsea, with some fans demanding to see Aaron Ramsdale restored in goal, but the coach stuck with his compatriot.
Sevilla carved out their best chance of the first period moments before Arsenal took the lead, with Youssef En-Nesyri dragging an effort narrowly wide after breaking into the area.  Related News   Sevilla expel fan over racism in Madrid draw  EPL: Arsenal stage late dramatic comeback at Chelsea  Napoli eye Jesus as Osimhen replacement   
After another Sevilla attack was cut short in stoppage time, Gabriel Jesus turned brilliantly in midfield to confound two Sevilla players and open up the pitch, before springing Martinelli through on goal with a quick pass.
The Brazilian showed composure to round Nyland and slot home on his Champions League debut with Ramos unable to catch him in pursuit.
– Jesus decisive –        
Arsenal last qualified for the tournament in 2017 and Arteta’s young side’s inexperience told in their defeat by Lens after having taken the lead, however this time they quickly found a second goal.
The otherwise quiet Martin Odegaard lashed over the bar early in the second half before Jesus dribbled into the box from the left flank and brilliantly thrashed a shot into the far top corner across Nyland.
Sevilla pulled one back just before the hour mark when Nemanja Gudelj headed home from Ivan Rakitic’s corner past the motionless Raya.
The Arsenal goalkeeper produced a spectacular save to tip Mariano Diaz’s effort on to the crossbar, although it would have been ruled out for a foul had it found a way in.
Sevilla beat Manchester United and Juventus last season at home in their Europa League run and refused to give in without trying everything, with former Tottenham winger Erik Lamela booked for diving in the area.
They turned the screw in the final stages, but Arsenal clung on for victory.

Much-maligned centre-back Maguire headed in the only goal 18 minutes from time before Onana saved Jordan Larsson’s penalty with the last kick of the game.
The English giants had lost their opening two Champions League group games for the first time in the club’s history, but are back in contention for the last 16 thanks to a much-needed win.
One of United’s greatest ever players, Charlton died on Saturday at the age of 86.


  
A moving tribute was paid to the 1966 World Cup winner before kick-off as United boss Erik ten Hag laid a wreath in the centre-circle before a minute’s silence was observed.
Ten Hag urged his players to be inspired by Charlton’s legacy after a difficult start to the season.
But the Dutchman would have been disheartened by another insipid first-half performance.      
The Danish champions were inches away from going in front after just five minutes.
Maguire was caught in possession by Mohamed Elyounoussi and the former Southampton forward’s cross was turned onto the post by Diogo Goncalves.
The emotional atmosphere around Old Trafford prior to kick-off quickly turned to groans of frustration at the home side laboured to create anything of note before the break.
Ten Hag responded by introducing Danish international Christian Eriksen against his countrymen.
However, it was not until two more big chances for Copenhagen to take a shock lead that United awoke from their slumber.
– Onana proves his worth –
Onana made high-profile errors in both United’s Champions League defeats to Bayern Munich and Galatasaray.        
But the man who helped Inter Milan reach the final of last season’s competition showed why United splashed out £47 million on him in July.
Onana’s first crucial save of the game prevented Lukas Lerager’s shot finding the top corner.  Related News   Superb Dalot help Man Utd to narrow win  Awoniyi aims to end 40-day goal drought  UCL: Unfortunate Meret hands Madrid win at Napoli   
Moments later Elias Achouri blasted a volley over when unmarked at the far post.
Rasmus Hojlund is Eriksen’s heir as the great hope of the Danish international side, but he failed to shine against his former club.
Hojlund’s most telling contribution came in teeing up Eriksen for a powerful low drive that former Liverpool goalkeeper Kamil Grabara did brilliantly to turn behind.
Marcus Rashford’s loss of form has contributed hugely to United’s struggles so far this season.
The England international, who scored 30 goals last season, has still netted only once this campaign and wasted a glorious chance to open the scoring with a heavy touch when one-on-one with Grabara.      
Substitute Alejandro Garnacho then did exactly the same with just Grabara to beat.
Instead centre-back Maguire bailed out his forwards to at least ensure Charlton’s farewell was marked with a victory.
The England international had fallen way down the pecking order during Ten Hag’s first season in charge, but is making the most of a series of defensive injuries that have brought him back into the fold.
Maguire just stayed onside to meet Eriksen’s cross with a bullet header 18 minutes from time.
United should have added a second as Garnacho and Scott McTominay passed up big chances to double the lead.
And they were nearly made to pay when McTominay was penalised for a high foot on Elyounoussi deep into stoppage time.
Larsson, son of former United striker Henrik Larsson, stepped forward but his powerful effort was turned behind by Onana to spark wild scenes of celebration.  
Victory takes United above Copenhagen into third in Group A and within one point of Galatasaray.
Bayern are already closing in on qualification after a 3-1 win over Galatasaray made it three wins from three games for the German giants.

Rodrygo put Real ahead and England star Bellingham made it 2-0 just after the hour mark, with Carlo Ancelotti’s side then holding on after Alvaro Djalo pulled one back for Braga.
The result leaves Madrid in a strong position with the maximum nine points from three games in Group C, three ahead of Napoli who beat Union Berlin 1-0 away in Germany.
After a cagey start, Nacho released Vinicius down the left flank and the Brazilian stood Serdar Saatci up before squaring for a sliding Rodrygo to give Madrid the lead on 16 minutes.


  
Madrid briefly thought they had doubled their lead 10 minutes before half-time when Rodrygo slotted the ball into an empty net, but Vinicius had strayed offside as Eduardo Camavinga played him in near the halfway line.
Bellingham doubled Madrid’s lead on 61 minutes when he stroked the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the box after being teed up by Vinicius.
It was his 11th goal in all competitions for Real since joining the record 14-time European champions from Borussia Dortmund ahead of this season.

However, the home side halved the deficit just two minutes later when Djalo powered a near-post drive past Kepa Arrizabalaga.
Braga then introduced the dangerous Bruma, who was only deemed fit enough to start on the bench. The change nearly paid off on 70 minutes when a Ricardo Horta drive was spooned just wide by Arrizabalaga.
Vinicius thought he had added a goal to his two assists on 82 minutes, but the assistant’s flag denied him with Madrid looking to kill off the game.
A VAR check for a penalty in the 89th minute was Braga’s last hope for an equaliser as Madrid ground out a hard-fought victory.
The Spanish side will be looking to book their place in the round of 16 when they host Braga in the return fixture on November 8.
Given the nod to start up front, Brazilian attacker Rodrygo will be hoping his goal will ensure his place in the starting XI for Saturday’s Clasico away to Barcelona.

Goals in each half from Alexis Sanchez and Hakan Calhanoglu were enough for Inter to move up to seven points, three ahead of Real Sociedad who are at bottom side Benfica later on Tuesday.
Simone Inzaghi’s side were good value for their win but were made to sweat for the three points as Salzburg caused the hosts problems and were briefly level when Oscar Gloukh stroked home a classy finish in the 57th minute.
A four-point gap between Inter and third-placed Salzburg makes qualification for the knockout stages more likely regardless of how Sociedad do in Portugal.


  
Sanchez’s finish will also cheer Inzaghi as it showed he can drop one of star strike pairing Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram without losing goal threat.
The Chile striker was a surprise pick in place of Thuram from Inzaghi, who also dropped star left-back Federico Dimarco and Nicolo Barella to the bench with a big Serie A clash with Roma coming up at the weekend.
Sanchez, 34, is now the highest scoring Chilean in Champions League history with 16 goals.      
Salzburg had if anything had the better of the play in the early stages but Sanchez pounced on Inter’s first real chance of the game to put the hosts ahead in the 19th minute.

Henrikh Mkhitaryan tried to feed Davide Frattesi who had made a burst into the box but his misplaced pass instead found Sanchez, who calmly stroked home his first Inter goal since returning from Marseille.
That goal took the wind out of Salzburg’s sails and Inter pressed for a second, but the closest they came in the first half was in the 32nd minute when Denzel Dumfries’ cross was almost turned in by Amar Dedic.
Inter almost doubled their lead in the 56th minute when Carlos Augusto flashed just wide but seconds later Gloukh drew Salzburg level with a brilliant first-time finish reminiscent of Sanchez’s opener after good play from Roko Simic and Maurits Kjaergaard.
However Inter responded and were soon back in the lead when Lucas Gourna-Douath and Strahinja Pavlovic clumsily bundled over Frattesi and referee Francois Letexier quickly pointed to the penalty spot.
Calhanoglu made no mistake with his spot-kick, rifling home what turned out to be the winning goal to the right of Alexander Schlager.
Lautaro Martinez thought he had sealed the points for Inter in the 81st minute, but the strike was ruled out, Frattesi straying offside before flashing a low cross for the Argentina forward.        
Salzburg pushed for a leveller but Inter held out for a win which will boost their chances of another deep run in the competition.

Musiala charged up the middle of the park to help create the opener for Kingsley Coman early, before Argentina striker Mauro Icardi won and converted a penalty to level the scores.
Musiala, still just 20, laid on a goal for Harry Kane before the England captain returned the favour, allowing the Germany midfielder to get a goal of his own.
Six-time winners Bayern came into the game hoping to protect a remarkable recent record in the Champions League.


  
The German champions travelled to Istanbul unbeaten in their past 36 matches in the group stages, including 19 away games.
Galatasaray, the only Turkish team to have won a European trophy having lifted the Europa League in 2000, were on a streak of their own, chalking up 17 matches without a loss before Bayern’s visit.
Coman got Bayern off to the best possible start, turning in a pinpoint Musiala pass after just eight minutes, his fourth goal in his past three games for the visiting Germans.      
Much of the pre-match talk surrounded the availability of Galatasaray’s Argentina striker Icardi.
While Tuchel said on Monday “my information is that he’s out for a while”, the former Paris Saint-Germain striker was named up front for the 24-time Turkish champions.  Related News   UCL: Inter squeeze past Salzburg to move top of Group D  UCL: Bayern, Galatasaray fans clash ahead of Istanbul match  Bundesliga: Kane scores as Bayern win at Mainz, Leverkusen go top   
Icardi soon made his presence felt, drawing a clumsy lunge in the box from Joshua Kimmich to win a penalty after 29 minutes.
The forward forced a dive from Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich, while he casually chipped a Panenka in to equalise.
Icardi then had a golden chance to give the hosts the lead a minute before the break, but Bayern defender Kim Min-jae arrived, forcing the striker to spray his shot wide.
As the second-half wore on, the home side turned up the volume in pursuit of a winner but it would be the visitors who struck next, Kane back-heeling in another Musiala assist.

A name that echoes with adoration among African football enthusiasts, Yekini’s journey through the beautiful game was nothing short of extraordinary. His prolific goal-scoring, passion, and unique celebrations made him a beloved figure, and his legacy lives on as Google celebrated the late icon’s 60th birthday by creating a doodle of the man who scored Nigeria’s first ever World Cup goal.
Nicknamed the ‘Goals Father’, Yekini is Nigeria’s top scorer with 37 goals and is widely considered the greatest Nigerian striker and one of the best in Africa.
Here, PUNCH Sports Extra celebrates the Top 10 moments of Yekini, who would have been 60 on Monday
First Eagles goal


  
Born on October 23, 1963 in Kaduna, Yekini’s remarkable football journey began in earnest when he scored his first goal for the Super Eagles on April 6, 1985 against Kenya in the 1986 World Cup qualifiers. This moment marked the beginning of a prolific international career, one that would see him become the Eagles’ all-time leading scorer with 37 goals in 58 appearances.
Three-time topscorer
He was the highest scorer in the Ivory Coast topflight league for three consecutive years (1988, 1989 and 1990) while playing in the colours of Africa Sports.      
AFCON 1992 Golden Boot 
Yekini scored four goals to claim the Golden Boot, as he led Nigeria to a bronze medal finish at the AFCON 1992 in Senegal.
African Footballer of The Year
In 1993, he was crowned the African Footballer of The Year, the first Nigerian to be so honoured, after his goals fired the Eagles to a first-ever qualification for the World Cup in 1994.

For the second time, Yekini claimed the AFCON Golden Boot in 1994 with five goals in Tunisia, but this time, the then 30-year-old, at the peak of his powers, led the Eagles to their second AFCON title, as he also claimed the tournament’s best player award. On his return to Nigeria, the Federal Government honoured him with the Member of The Order of The Niger award.
First World Cup goal        
Nigeria’s maiden appearance at the FIFA World Cup in 1994 was historic, and Yekini played a pivotal role in etching this moment in football history. In the opening game against highly fancied Bulgaria, the former Vitoria Setubal man netted Nigeria’s first-ever goal in a World Cup, in a 3–0 win against the Europeans, with his celebration after scoring, crying while holding the goal’s net, becoming one of the iconic images of the tournament and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.
True Goals Father
Ye-King as he was also fondly called, had a blistering goals-laden club career. He scored 45 league goals in 53 games for his first club Shooting Stars, 80 goals in 100 games for Abiola, 112 goals in 130 games for Ivorian giants Africa Sports, 94 goals in 148 Babes for Portuguese side Setubal and many more.
Primeira Liga Golden Boot
The late striker was the top scorer in the Portuguese Primeira Liga in the 1993/94 season after finding the back of the net 21 times to win the Golden Boot in his last season with Vitoria Setubal.
34-goal season
In the previous campaign (1992/93), Yekini netted a career-best 34 goals in only 32 games to help Setubal secure promotion from the Portuguese second division to the Primeira Liga.      
Return from retirement
In April 2005, 41-year-old Yekini made a short comeback, moving alongside former national teammate Mobi Oparaku to Gateway United FC. The veteran proved he still knew how to find the net, scoring seven goals in 26
appearances.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/23134639/183955-scaled.webp

Sadiq last scored against Atletico Madrid and has not found the back of the net in the 11 games he has played since he returned from a cruciate ligament injury.
The Nigerian has made 10 substitute appearances so far this season for Real Sociedad, the Spanish side will hope their striker adds to his tally in the encounter as they hope to maintain their lead in Group D having recorded a win and a draw from their opening two games.
Expressing his excitement about playing in the competition, Sadiq told Omasports, “It’s a dream for every footballer and I’m living my dream. I hope to score in the tournament as well.”

Oki was suspended by the LSFA board last Tuesday for “gross misconduct” by a simple majority of five to four after a quorum was formed in a meeting.
Video footage showed Oki hitting at a camera meant to cover the meeting after he allegedly punched his vice chairman Liameed Gafar.
The board members had accused Oki of not attending the NFF Congress in September with no excuse and without the knowledge of the LSFA board. He was also accused of changing the association’s logo without the approval of the board and state congress.


  
They also faulted Oki for preventing clubs in Lagos —  in the Nigerian National League and the Nigeria Premier Football League — from streaming their home games on their respective social media platforms and mandating clubs in the state competing in the NNL to pay a fee of N500,000 for access to the Mobolaji Johnson Arena and N800,000 from clubs participating in the NPFL.
Our correspondent learnt that both Oki and Gafaar and members of the LSFA board were summoned to a meeting by the Lagos State Chief of Staff, Tayo Ayinde, last Thursday in a bid to resolve the lingering crisis rocking the body.

During the meeting, which reportedly lasted for about four hours, it was gathered that Ayinde asked Oki and Gafaar if they could continue to work together. While Oki agreed to continue to work in his position with his vice chairman, Gafaar, it was learnt, declined.      
Ayinde further relayed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s message to the duo, insisting that they must work together to develop football in the state. He also asked Gafaar what he wanted to be done to resolve the crisis.
Our correspondent further learnt that Gafaar demanded that the chairman (Oki) operated fairly with every member of the board and be considerate in his decisions as it affected football.
“It was a heated meeting where Gafaar and some board members bared their minds on what has been happening,” a board member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The PUNCH.
“The chairman pleaded to keep his place but that will be resolved on Tuesday (today). Three other board members who approved his suspension last Tuesday said at the meeting that they could not continue with their decision against Oki.
“So, we await what happens from the meeting but I hope the chairman rescinds the poor football decisions he made, which can affect the growth of the game and the emerging clubs in Lagos in the long term.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/17222331/Fouad-Oki.jpg

She teasingly made this known during an event tagged ‘off in style’ which was put together to celebrate her retirement.
Oparanozie last month brought an end to her illustrious career after she announced her retirement from both country and club football at the age of 29.
The forward called time on a glittering career that saw her win the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations four times, play at the World Cup four times. She also had a bus stop named after her in France, following her heroics at Guingamp.


  
Before her retirement, Oparanozie made 35 appearances for the Super Falcons and scored 22 goals.
The Owerri-born striker started her football journey in the Nigerian Women’s League with Bayelsa Queens, before moving on to Delta Queens in 2010, from where her adventure to Europe began on loan to Turkey.
Oparanozie last played for Chinese Women’s Super League club Wuhan Jianghan University for the 2022 season, before she bowed out after injuries ravaged the latter part of her career.      
Now away from the pitch, the 29-year-old, while not so serious about her next move, hinted that she could venture into UFC.  Related News   Usman suffers third straight UFC defeat  Jones backs Adesanya over UFC break  Adesanya takes UFC break   
“I would love to try out UFC one day now that I am retired from football,” she said.
The 29-year-old was part of the Falcons squad that featured at the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
It was her fourth appearance at the World Cup after making her debut at the 2011 edition in Germany.
While people were rooting for her to lead Nigeria to next year’s Olympics in Paris, Oparanozie announced her retirement, much to the disappointment of many fans.
The former Bayelsa Queens striker admitted that she left the game early but was pleased with her decision.
“It was something I had thought all over, I know I left the game early and I have not really had the opportunity to apologise to my fans.        
“It is something that is definitely going to happen but a lot of people are not happy that I left the game too early but I want to thank them for the love they showed me.”

Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, has not reached an agreement to join Liverpool or any club in the summer, contrary to reports, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.
According to trusted transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, Osimhen is yet to decide on his future and has not reached an agreement with Napoli over a new deal despite
reports from Italy suggesting otherwise.


  
The Partenopei has reportedly offered the Nigerian striker a lucrative contract — the biggest in the club’s history.
The striker has scored 65 goals in 111 games for the Italian side since joining from Lille in 2020, with his epic tally of 31 in 39 games last season impressive.
So far this season, the Nigerian has notched six goals in 10 appearances in all competition and despite his injury, interest from top clubs across Europe is not cooling      
off anytime soon.
Romano told Caught Offside, “Chelsea are still keeping an eye on Osimhen, but despite some media reports in Italy stating that he’s agreed a contract with Liverpool, my understanding is that he hasn’t agreed anything with any club.  Related News   Liverpool reach personal terms with Osimhen  De Laurentiis won’t rule out Osimhen exit  Reds join Chelsea, Arsenal in Osimhen race   
“There is not even an agreement over a new contract with Napoli, despite receiving a huge offer from his current club.
“Osimhen will take his time, but for now I can say the links with Liverpool are untrue. Of course, Liverpool and many other clubs are keeping an eye on top strikers around Europe, but nothing was agreed upon, Osimhen will take his time. We’ll have to wait and see how it will evolve, even if it is sure to be one to watch in 2024.”
Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis had hoped that Osimhen would extend his contract with the club beyond 2025. Still, things appear to have changed in recent weeks in the wake of his TickTok row with Napoli.
De Laurentiis held multiple meetings with Osimhen’s agent, Roberto Calenda, after the summer transfer window closed and there were reports that an extension was nearly done. Still, doubts have since emerged over what is next for the striker.
“I have never been unhappy towards Osimhen, but there are always two of us in these things,” said the president.        
“I have remained the same, if his mood has changed over a new deal I can’t do anything about it.
“If things change after a handshake, it’s disappointing, we take note of it but then life goes on.
“There are excellent relations with him but his contract expires in 2025, there is time. Don’t forget that I sold Koulibaly (to Chelsea) a year before his contract expired.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/27223040/Victor-Osimhen.jpg

How Yobo, Mikel ended rift to lead Eagles to shocking Ivory Coast win at AFCON 2013","The rift between former Super Eagles captains Joseph Yobo and Mikel Obi at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa inspired the team to their third African title in South Africa, Ogenyi Onazi h...","<span class=""post-date""> 24th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/revealed-how-yobo-mikel-ended-rift-to-lead-eagles-to-shocking-ivory-coast-win-at-afcon-2013/,  Johnny Edward,"The rift between former Super Eagles captains Joseph Yobo and Mikel Obi at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa inspired the team to their third African title in South Africa, Ogenyi Onazi has revealed.
The Eagles, under late coach Stephen Keshi, started the tournament on a shaky note recording 1-1 draws against Burkina Faso and Zambia in their opening two group games but they bounced back with a 2-0 win over Ethiopia courtesy of a brace from Victor Moses in their last game of the group.
Their qualification for the next round saw the Eagles draw huge tournament favourites Ivory Coast in the quarter-finals — a tie which saw them team tagged ‘underdogs’ by many football enthusiasts.
But against the run of play, the Eagles defeated the star-studded Ivorians 2-1 to reach the semi-final of the competition.


  
Tournament top scorer Emmanuel Emenike opened the scoring with a long-range shot that sailed right through the arms of Ivory Coast goalkeeper Boubacar Barry two minutes before half-time.
The late Cheikh Tiote equalised early in the second half with a header as he stole in unmarked at the back post.
Sunday Mba then scored 12 minutes from time to hand Nigeria a shock 2-1 quarter-final win and knock favourites Ivory Coast out of the tournament.      
The Eagles went on to win the title for a third time following a 4-1 win over Mali in the semi-final with goals from Elderson Echiejile, Ahmed Musa, Ideye Brown, and an own goal from Momo Sissoko.
In the final against Burkina Faso, a solitary strike from Mba secured the title for Nigeria in Johannesburg.
Speaking with Soccernet, Onazi, who made five appearances at the tournament revealed that Yobo took a swipe at Mikel during a team talk prior to the Eagles quarter-final game against Les Elephants.  Related News   Hazard laziest player I’ve seen – Mikel  Mikel backs struggling Blues to bounce back  Ndidi contacts Yobo, Emenike amidst Fenerbahçe interest   
“Something interesting happened before the match against Ivory Coast,” Onazi said.
“The Big Boss (Keshi) had a meeting with the team after our lunch and when he finished, Joseph Yobo, the captain, said we should all wait.
“He had been having this little issue with Mikel. So immediately, the coaching staff left, he took a swipe at Mikel immediately, saying, I know I have some issues with Mikel, but that’s okay. We have a very important game (against Ivory Coast) ahead of us and I know I am not starting this game, but I know you guys in there will do us proud.
“Yes, we must have these small fights, but it is to strengthen us and show us that we are strong as a team and I wish you guys all the best.        
“You guys go out there and prove that we can beat these guys. It is good that we are the underdogs, and it’s better we are already written off by our country. We know that we have tickets already to go back to our country and clubs.”
Onazi also revealed that Mikel responded, saying, “Guys, yes, we will fight ourselves inside, but let’s fight our opponents outside.”
Meanwhile, the three-time African champions will face hosts Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea and Guinea Bissau in Group A of the 2023 AFCON next year.
The tournament will be played in Ivory Coast between January 13 and February 11, 2024.

Agba, who recently received approval for his outfit, Emeka Agba Boxing Promotions, from the NBBofC, added that he had what it took to organise regular bouts that would bring out the best in Nigerian fighters.
He told PUNCH Sport Extra that as a first step in this direction, his outfit would organise a boxing championship tagged ‘Ring Matadors’ at the National Stadium, Lagos November 11.
Agba is keen to have the boxers that fight under his promotion remain based in Nigeria.


  
“We have resources wasting away all over the country, and when I am talking about resources, I mean people, there are youths sitting idle who can make an impact in boxing,” he told The PUNCH.
“So, we are going to pick the youths that have determination and passion, we will house them, bring in world-class trainers and develop them, take them to compete nationally and internationally and in the next five years. I promise we will have a Nigerian-made world boxing champion. And after they get that title, they will come back to Nigeria, they will be based here.”  Related News   UK-based Agbaje decries state of Nigerian boxing facilities

“I must commend Chief Emeka Agba for joining the list of boxing promoters in the country, which will help in giving our boxers hope and greater opportunity to have regular fights and be in a position to get good rankings and progress further in the profession.
“On developing  a world champion that is Nigerian-born and Nigeria-based, it is very very possible and I know that with the right environment and orientation, most of our boxers who turn professional would be keen to operate in Nigeria,” he said.

Ange Postecoglou’s side extended their unbeaten start to nine league games thanks to Son’s opener and Maddison’s first goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since his close-season move from Leicester.
Tottenham leapfrogged Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool to go two points clear at the top of the table.
Fulham are the only team to beat Tottenham this season, knocking them out of the League Cup on penalties in August.


  
But they avenged that loss by recording a third successive league victory to strengthen their unexpected title challenge.
The north Londoners’ superb start to Postecoglou’s debut season has awoken dreams of the club’s first top-flight title since Bill Nicholson’s 1961 double-winners.
While that ambitious target may yet prove beyond Tottenham, who haven’t won a major trophy since 2008, the Australian has undoubtedly had a huge impact on a club that was in turmoil when he arrived from Celtic.      
A toxic combination of Tottenham’s poor results and dour displays under Antonio Conte last term, combined with Harry Kane’s close-season move to Bayern Munich, left many expecting another year of turmoil.
Yet Postecoglou has astutely guided Tottenham to calmer waters, winning over doubters with his down-to-earth personality and attacking game plan.
Monday’s victory gave Postecoglou the record for most points gained by a new manager in their first nine Premier League matches, with his 23 surpassing the mark previously held by Mike Walker and Guus Hiddink.
Postecoglou’s next challenge is ensuring his players are ready for a quick turnaround, with their London derby at Crystal Palace scheduled for Friday.

In keeping with their vibrant form under Postecoglou, Tottenham made an enterprising start and Son was denied an early goal by Bernd Leno’s smart save from his close-range shot.
Heading into this weekend, no player had provided more assists in the competition this term than Maddison’s five.        
The playmaker nearly added to that tally when his free-kick was volleyed over by Micky van de Ven.
Fulham almost snatched a shock lead through Joao Palhinha, whose header was brilliantly clawed to safety by Guglielmo Vicario.
Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg tested Leno with a fierce strike before Richarlison side-footed just wide from the edge of the area.
Tottenham’s pressure was rewarded in the 36th minute as Calvin Bassey carelessly surrendered possession and Richarlison flicked a pass to Son on the edge of the area.
Son’s deft touch took him away from two flat-footed Fulham defenders, giving him time to curl a fine finish into the far corner for his seventh goal this season.
Dejan Kulusevski’s goal-bound strike was deflected wide for a corner as Tottenham pushed for a second.
They had to wait just nine minutes after half-time before delivering the knockout blow, with a hearty assist from Fulham’s lacklustre defence.      
Kane’s departure was expected to destabilise Tottenham, but Son and Maddison have formed a dynamic duo almost as effective as the South Korean’s prolific partnership with the England captain.
Hojbjerg intercepted a miscued Bassey clearance and picked out Son, who laid a composed pass into Maddison to apply the finishing touch with a low strike from 10 yards.

The United Trinity statue outside the ground was awash with tributes to Charlton on Sunday as supporters laid flowers and scarves, with many leaving deeply personal thoughts for one of the club’s most famous sons, following his death aged 86.
A book of condolence was opened at the International Suite inside the stadium, while current boss Erik Ten Hag and members of the United squad added their messages at Carrington.
United confirmed discussions were continuing to take place with Charlton’s family and UEFA for further commemorative plans ahead of Tuesday night’s Champions League Group A match against Copenhagen.


  
It is expected players will wear black armbands, with wreaths to be laid on the Old Trafford pitch and a minute’s silence observed ahead of kick-off.
A key member of England’s victorious 1966 World Cup team, Charlton also enjoyed great success at club level with United, who became the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968.
Charlton made his debut for United in 1956 and went on to play 758 matches, scoring 249 goals.      
Both were long-standing club records until they were overtaken by Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney, respectively. He was knighted for services to football in 1994.
Having won three league titles and one FA Cup at Old Trafford, Charlton left United in 1973 and went on to manage Preston before returning to the Red Devils 11 years later as a club director.
David Moyes took over from Sir Alex Ferguson as Manchester United manager in the summer of 2013, but the former Everton boss left the club after just 10 months, with the team seventh on the Premier League table.
Now in charge at West Ham, Moyes reflected on the support shown by Charlton during what was one of the most testing spells of his managerial career.
“I’m deeply saddened and I send my condolences to all his family. The biggest thing everyone remembers, more than anything, is how great a man he was. He was such a good man,” Moyes said, quoted on West Ham’s club website.
“For me, it was difficult at times at Manchester United and he was incredibly supportive and always had something to say to me.
“He had a great wife in Lady Norma and even when I lost my job; she phoned my wife up, which was important at the time.        
“For me, he carried off all the things that Manchester United were good for. He showed the traditions, he showed exactly how it should be.
“He showed great humility wherever he went, but not only that at Manchester United, he was ultimately one of the main people in English football over the years.

“When you think of the greats who have come through English football, Bobby Charlton would be in there.”
It was announced on Saturday afternoon that Charlton had died peacefully in the early hours of the morning surrounded by his family.
Born in Ashington on Oct. 11, 1937, Charlton played in the World Cup final alongside his brother Jack – who died aged 85 in 2020 – and won 106 caps for England, scoring 49 goals.
European Cup success with United came 10 years after the Munich air disaster, which Charlton and manager Sir Matt Busby survived, but which claimed the lives of eight of his team-mates.
Former team-mate Denis Law said on manutd.com: “Another sad day. What can I say? Sir Bobby was an unbelievable player and a gentleman. Manchester United meant everything to him.      
“We had many special and successful years together and he was a joy to play with. He knew where every player was on the pitch and for me, that was a dream. I knew, if Bobby had the ball, it would find me and it did.
“What a striker of the ball he was. He could hit the ball so hard that I knew most keepers didn’t stand a chance. On the rare occasion they did manage to deflect it, it would drop nicely to me to finish it off.
“Along with George (Best), our partnership was sealed. The great part of playing with Bobby and George was that if one of us was having a bad day, the other two knew and that’s what made our relationship special.
“I am saddened by the news, like all football fans today.”
Charlton was diagnosed with dementia and his condition was made public in November 2020, two days after his United and England team-mate Nobby Stiles died following his battle with the illness.
Tributes were left at Old Trafford this weekend, one which read: “Thank you, Sir Bobby, a hero to the worldwide football family.”
A message from a fan group, 1958, said: “History, dignity and integrity are what you gave to our great club. Our promise to you is to make sure it stays.”  
Manchester United Women manager, Marc Skinner, dedicated Sunday’s 5-0 win at Everton to Charlton.
“He changed football in my opinion, especially at my club, so that was for him and his family,” Skinner said.

Agbese, who represents Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadibo Federal Constituency, Benue State, gave the clarification while fielding questions from journalists at the end of plenary on Tuesday.
The PUNCH reports that the House of Representatives Committee on Anti-Corruption, in a letter dated October 11, 2023, summoned the Managing Director of REA, Mr Salihijo Ahmad, over multi-billion-naira fraud allegedly perpetrated under his watch.
The summons was against the backdrop of a petition by a civil society group, the Centre Against Injustice and Domestic Violence, alleging the perpetration of several improprieties by the Ahmad-led management team, including a purported N1.5 billion fraud in the electricity agency recently. 
The Managing Director subsequently appeared before the Kayode Akiolu-led investigative committee on allegations of fraud, criminal conspiracy, and diversion of public funds levelled against him and about 15 others.
Agbese said, “The 10th House of Representatives, under the leadership of Tajudeen Abbas, is a house guided by rules and regulations. We have our procedure, like every other parliament across the world. So when issues are raised, they are to be considered meticulously, and of course, we will always ensure that justice is done.
“For instance, you mentioned the issue of Tetfund. The Committee on Tetfund has actually done its investigation. They have submitted their report, and those of you who one way or the other may have access to the report, can see that the Tetfund was not indicted in any way.

“You mentioned the issue of Rural Electrification Agency. Petitions were raised by members of the society. Some of these petitions were directly sent to Public Accounts and Public Petitions Committee, which provides oversight of that agency.
“You see, for us in the 10th Assembly, we are not desperate to criminalise any individual for doing his or her duty.
“I think in the case of the REA MD, he has been able to appear before these individuals (committees) and has cleared himself before the Public Account Committee. He has cleared himself before other committees like anti-corruption, crimes and all of that.
“If you come with your scorecard and you are able to demonstrate such before Parliament that you are not guilty of whatever thing that anybody has raised against you; then it is fine.
“We all know the principle that you cannot listen to one party to judge. Secondly, there is another parliamentary principle of law that, when two persons are involved in an issue, you cannot listen to one party alone.”
He continued, “The REA MD has appeared before some of these committees, and listening to both parties, I think we aligned ourselves with the judgement of most Nigerians that this is a young man who has actually been able to perform creditably well with the responsibility saddled on him by Mr President.
“So, I just want to use this opportunity to tell Nigerians that we are not witch-hunting anyone. We are here for all Nigerians.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/21231921/Philip-Agbese.jpeg

Montgomery also raised observations about the numerous post-election cases at both the state and federal levels, saying it was important for the diplomatic mission to understand how the processes are playing out.
The high commissioner raised these concerns when he led a delegation to the headquarters of the ruling All Progressives Congress in Abuja, where he was received by the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje.
The development comes hours after the Chief of Defence Staff, General Christopher Musa, announced that the military was prepared for the off-cycle polls in the three states. 
Musa further warned that any act of violence would not be condoned before, during, and after the elections.
But Montgomery, who also admitted to having visited leading opposition parties before coming to the APC secretariat, called for fair play and a level playing field for the candidates contesting.
He said, “As explained in our private meeting earlier, I, as British High Commissioner, have a role to understand the politics of this great country and to engage with the political parties to understand both the priorities, challenges and opportunities of the political process in Nigeria so that I can explain it to my ministers back in London. I also need to understand your perspectives on a number of issues.

“As I am doing here, we met other members of the political leadership of different political parties across the country. Obviously, there are topical concerns that we have touched on like the gubernatorial elections, the runoff by-elections in Imo, Bayelsa and in Kogi. That we wish to understand and are watching carefully to see the process and the way it is carried out.
“We’ve discussed a number of the legal issues present in the political domain at federal and state level. It’s important for us as a diplomatic mission to understand how those processes are playing out. We admire the way Nigeria is using the courts to settle disputes of elections at every level when they occur. And we appreciate that process. So your excellency, I’ve come to pay my respects to you my congratulations and gain your insights and wisdom and to pay my respects to this great party that has helped shape Nigeria’s democracy,”
Welcoming the British delegation, Ganduje acknowledged the long history between both countries and how they both practised a parliamentary system at one point.
“We are so pleased to have you given the relationship and long history between Britain and Nigeria. You are our colonial masters. We got our independence from you and you know our country, even though things are dynamic.
“We started with a political system similar to your own because we borrowed from you and after independence, you assisted us to form political parties as well as to conduct elections during that time. But along the line, our political system changed from Prime Minister to presidential system. So that is where the differences are.
“It is very encouraging and we’ll take the opportunity to also seek for your permission to visit your country and discuss with the political parties that are there, especially as the ruling party, to underdtand the relationship between the political party and the government in power and their role in assisting good governance.
“So you can see that if the political party is not well structured, not well established, democracy itself is defective. So we thank you for coming. We look forward to having stronger ties and to learn more from you because you have older political institutions than our own country. You have seen it all but our own is an evolutionary one, which we want to take a much higher level,” he stated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/25104256/rich.jpg

The state APC spokesperson, Darlington Nwauju, confirmed this while speaking with newsmen in Port Harcourt on Tuesday.
Nwauju said the records of the appeal have been compiled and transmitted to the appropriate quarters and a suit number allocated.
He stated, “I can confirm to the media today, October 24, 2023, that our governorship candidate, Pastor Tonye Cole, has entered an appeal against the ruling of the Governorship and National Assembly Tribunal for Rivers State.
“The records of this particular matter have been compiled and transmitted and the suit number allocated. The suit number is CA/ABJ/EP/Gov/RV/121/2023. 
“We do pray and hope that the Court of Appeal and indeed the judiciary will be able to serve justice to the people of Rivers State and to the memories of all those who were killed for their political belief for following and supporting the APC in Rivers State.

“We pray we will get justice from the court and as a law-abiding political party, we will always abide by the decisions of the court.”
He however faulted some of the grounds by which the tribunal dismissed the petition brought before it, saying they neither made sense nor complied with the provisions of the Electoral Act.      
Nwauju said,  “We want to draw attention to the fact that some of the grounds for dismissing the petition that was entered at the tribunal which was the court of first instance are grossly unacceptable and do not make sense even to the common man, giving the facts that the Constitution has clearly and indeed the Electoral Act, Section 133 Subsection 1 has given fillip to candidates of political parties to challenge outcomes of electoral matters.
“And they do have an independent right different from that of political parties. So the tribunal that sat over our case told Nigerians that Tonye Cole does not have the right to challenge the outcome of the governorship election in Rivers State.”
He added that this is contrary to what the Electoral Act 2022 as amended has said in black and white, among the examples, saying “We do hope and pray to get justice served.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/01183932/Tonye-Cole.jpg

Uzor, in a statement in Awka, on Tuesday, said that Obiano must be made to account for “the wasted eight years”, he held sway as the governor.
He expressed disappointment that for eight years Obiano could not do anything in the state that would have a direct impact on the people, adding that he left the state in abject poverty.
He said, “Obiano’s legacies were glorified airports, stadiums, and all white elephant projects that don’t have direct bearing on the people of the state. 
“Even local government chairmen, during his administration should be probed as most of them became so corrupt that they syphoned the allocations made for the development of their local governments.
“Under Obiano, touts took over Anambra State; there was no single good road in the state, including his community, Aguleri.
“Until his successor Prof. Chukwuma Soludo awarded Niger Street leading to Onitsha Main Market, Obiano did not consider its strategic economic importance, including all the bad roads in Fegge, Onitsha.”      
Uzor, however, advised Soludo to avoid his predecessor’s pitfalls and should remain focused and render a monthly account of state revenue generation.  Related News   PICTORIAL: EFCC operatives allegedly held hostage by staff, students of Oyo college  Court jails man for land fraud in Maiduguri  Tinubu, prosecute Bawa or release him   
“Soludo should hasten the ongoing road construction, especially the Niger Street to Main Market, Ziks Avenue, Port Harcourt Road, Mbonu Ojike street, Miss Elems, Creeks Road, Bida road Silas Works road all in Fegge and equally engage youth to reduce high crime rate in the state,” Uzor added.
However, while reacting, Obiano’s former Deputy Press Secretary and a public communication expert, Emeka Ozumba, dismissed the claims by the group, insisting that his former boss served Anambra well and should be left alone to have his quiet life.
Ozumba said, “I will be more concerned to know whether their claims of ‘mismanagement’ is the fact that the former governor left some legacy projects that were hitherto not available in Anambra like the international cargo airport in Umueri, the International Convention Centre that can host International events and has revenue potential for the state.
“Or that he built oxygen centre which saved many lives when other states had none and able to supply oxygen through the period of COVID-19 season. Or is it the 20-million youth project that impacted on the youths across the LGAs that the former governor did and other numerous achievements which are there to speak for him?
“If they are claiming that he ‘mismanaged’ Anambra, then they should come out with proofs. I know a great number of Anambra residents will be anxious to refute their claims. The group is just seeking for attention and with some tendencies and hidden agenda.
“I will say Obiano has served his term and with all due respect, he left his mark, it is left for posterity to judge him. If anybody has any case against him, they should come with their concrete evidence and the former governor has the right under the law to defend himself.        
“Concerning his inability to conduct LG elections, I am aware there were certain things under the law which hindered the process of LG elections as of then and which the former governor abided to.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17171134/Governor-Willie-Obiano.jpg

The Red Chamber was, however, silent on the actual cost of each vehicle but explained that members preferred the imported SUVs to locally manufactured ones.
Earlier, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project asked a Federal High Court in Lagos to stop the lawmakers from taking delivery of the SUVs pending the hearing and determination of the applications for injunction filed by the organisation.
The group’s applications for interim and interlocutory injunction followed reports that members of the House of Representatives are set to procure and take delivery of SUVs valued at N57.6 billion. According to reports, each of the SUVs would cost about N160 million. 
Reacting to the development at a news conference on Tuesday, the Chairman of the Committee on Senate Services, Sunday Karimi, noted that Nigerians were picking on lawmakers but ignoring ministers who got about four official vehicles.
Karimi said, “Somebody that is a minister has more than three Land Cruisers, Prado and other vehicles and you are not asking them questions, why us?
“These vehicles that you see, go to Nigeria roads today, If I go home once, my senatorial district, I come back spending a lot on my vehicles because our roads are bad.      
“I said the decision that we took on using Land Cruiser is the cost and durability.”
He explained further, “Before they came up with this. It is not the decisions of the senators alone, we analysed arriving at Land Cruisers.
“It was based on a comparative analysis of the cost of technical issues and durability on Nigerian roads.

” We want something that we can maintain for another four years and the issue of buying vehicles from the National Assembly, you know it is a recurring issue, it occurs every assembly, it will always come up. “
The lawmaker further explained that even at the state level, assembly members had access to official vehicles.
Karimi added, “If you got to state Houses of Assembly today, check out, most of them before they were even inaugurated, the governor would have bought vehicles waiting for them even local government chairmen.
“I drove the vehicle my local government chairman uses, so why the National Assembly?”        
Justifying the high cost of the vehicles, Karimi said it was because the National Assembly owed the suppliers about N16bn.
He said, “I am the chairman of, the senate service. When I came into the senate, when they gave me their liability, they had a liability of over N16 billion that is made up of different vehicles of the 7th, 8th and 9th Assemblies.
“If you are a businessman and you supply vehicles for somebody in 2014 or 2015 or so and up till now they owed you.
“I am not trying to defend anybody, if you see them selling Land Cruisers in the market let’s say it is A cost, you don’t expect somebody that will supply it to supply it at the price they are selling it in the market.
“It has to leave a margin and the civil service for supply allowed for 25% margin plus that and VAT and I think that VAT is 7.5. Out of that 25% margin, they will still remove 5% tax from it.
“You are telling someone to supply and he may even not end up making payment for three years and you want him to supply at the price they are selling in the market, it is not possible.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/24181447/Sunday-Karimi.png

Abiodun, represented by his Deputy, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, made this pledge while speaking at the Citizen’s Engagement on the 2024–2026 Medium Term Expenditure Framework  and 2024 Budget for Ogun East Senatorial District, held in Ijebu-Ode.
The governor said the exercise will enhance the transparency of the budget process and budget documentation so that policy goals and resource allocation are set out.
He said, “I must tell you that we are so keen on this exercise based on our style of governance and our avowed pledge to you to be open and accountable in all ways and to run an inclusive administration where everyone is involved in the decision-making process. 
“As you all know, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework enhances the transparency of the budget process and budget documentation so that policy goals and resource allocation are clearly set out.
“It empowers the government to determine priorities and seamlessly deliver democratic deliverables without predilection or sentiment.
“Our vision for Ogun State is to provide focused and qualitative governance and to create the enabling environment for a public-private sector partnership, which is fundamental to the creation of enduring economic development and individual prosperity.      
“That promise is still fresh in our hearts and remains irrevocable; this is why our infrastructural investments are people-oriented and transformational, with resultant and obvious multiplier effects on the socio-economic development of the state.

“In the area of agriculture, we initiated various programmes that include a partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the Anchor Borrowers Scheme on Agriculture, under which tens of thousands of our people are being empowered with already cleared farmland by the government, facilitate the acquisition of seedlings and seeds, and provide access to finance.
“We keyed into this programme because of the immense potential of agriculture to provide employment for our teeming youth,” he noted.
At the microeconomic level, these programmes provide job opportunities in agriculture for our youth and women, thereby providing income and food for themselves and their families, and on the macroeconomic level, they will be another boost to Nigeria’s food self-sufficiency agenda.
Also speaking, the Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Olaolu Olabimtan, said the programme was aimed at making governance a bottom-top approach.        
“The inputs from the people are being generated to make the aim of MTEF achievable.
In his contribution, the Awujale of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Adetona, who was represented by Orimolusi of Ijebu Igbo, Oba Lawrence Adebajo, called for the opening up of rural areas to discourage rural-urban drift.
Oba Adetona said the opening up of rural areas, apart from reducing unemployment, will also fight the insecurity that is bedevilling the state.

They have, therefore, declared that there is no alternative to his candidature in the political contest.
Sylva, a son of Okpoama in the Brass LGA, was disqualified by a Federal High Court in Abuja presided over by Justice Donatus Okorowo on October 10 for having been sworn in twice and ruled for five years as governor of Bayelsa and would breach the 1999 constituency as amended. The case, marked FHC/ABJ/CS/821/2023, was filed by a member of the APC, Deme Kolomo.
They announced their position in a communique after a one-day APC Chiefs Conference in Yenagoa, the state capital, which was attended by over 400 delegates from about 14 councils of chiefs in the Nembe and Brass council areas, on Monday. 
In the Nembe tradition, the chiefs’ councils are the highest decision-making organs in terms of the political, economic and social life of the Nembe-speaking areas.
The chairman of the Opu-Nembe Council of Chiefs, Yousuo Donald Theo-Iruo, who read the communique to newsmen, said it had become necessary for the Nembe ethnic nationality to take a position ahead of the forthcoming governorship polls.
He said, “Today, we are excited that this meeting has been successfully held. At a time like this, this is our usual practice. First, we want to thank the Federal Government for allowing us to choose our leader again; to choose who should be our governor.

“And for us, we have deliberated and resolved today that the entire Nembe ethnic nationality across these local governments; that as the Conference of APC Chiefs in Nembe and Brass Local Government Areas we have decided to adopt, affirm and endorse His Excellency, Timipre Marlin Sylva as the candidate of these two local governments.
“We have made this affirmation that we will go back to our communities where our councils are domiciled to ensure that Chief Timipre Sylva is elected. There is no alternative to Chief Timipre Sylva as far as these councils are concerned.”
Theo-Iruo said the people of Nembe believe that they will have a face in the governance of the state when the APC standard bearer is elected as governor, and that he will spread the dividends of democracy to all parts of the state.
Giving further reasons for their decision, he said, “We also want to reaffirm our belief in Timipre Sylva, because having known him in his first tenure when he was governor we strongly believe that, for now, he is more experienced, exposed, connected, and we believe that he will take us to a Bayelsa of our dream where equity and fairness will be the hallmark of the people of Bayelsa.
“We strongly believe that Timipre has the right connections; he is the right person with the right exposure and he will be the man to beat in this forthcoming election. So today the respected chiefs of these Nembe-speaking local governments, in their various councils, have decided to speak with one voice and we will not only speak with one voice, we will direct, coordinate and ensure that this is the way to go for our people.
“This is our affirmation. Today, we stand with Timipre as a governorship candidate come November 11. We want to see that we will be connected to the national through Timipre. We cannot exist in isolation from the stream of national politics. And the only sure bet that will give us this status as a people is Timipre Sylva. This is our position and it is incontrovertible. This is our mission and we must work towards achieving it, and he is the candidate of the people.”
After reading the communique, Theo-Iruo also conducted a voice vote to further affirm the decision of the conference to which all the delegates chorused aye with no dissenting nay.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20172737/Timipre-Sylva.jpg

The warning is coming hours after the Chairman of the Supreme Court panel hearing the appeals against Tinubu’s election, Justice John Okoro, asked the Peoples Democratic Party standard bearer, Atiku Abubakar, to prove his allegation of certificate forgery levelled against the ex-Lagos State governor beyond a reasonable doubt.
Okoro handed down the admonition during the hearing of the election petition appeals filed by Atiku and Peter Obi of the Labour Party.

“We unequivocally assert that following a meticulous examination, the APC USA and the Committee of Diaspora have yet to unearth any substantive evidence to suggest that President Tinubu’s diploma, as tendered to the Independent National Electoral Commission, is a fraudulent document. This consequential and encouraging outcome should assuage any lingering apprehensions regarding the President’s academic background.
“We fervently implore opposition factions and all political stakeholders to uphold the legal process’s tenets and refrain from actions that may precipitate ignominy upon our nation.

Ogun, a former PDP State Secretary, who said that the party had the followership, strength and popularity to reclaim the state from Governor Biodun Oyebanji in 2026, said: “Never again will the party allow the personal interest of individuals to override the corporate interest of committed members”.
This came barely 24 hours after former Governor Ayodele Fayose of the PDP publicly endorsed Oyebanji of the APC for a second term in office given the incumbent’s performance within a year in office.
Ogun, who was a commissioner under Fayose’s administration, in a statement in Ado Ekiti on Monday, titled, ‘PDP on course to reclaim Ekiti with a female governor in 2026’, pleaded with party members and supporters to “reset your mindset and have the conviction that we can reclaim the state from Oyebanji in 2026. 
“Also, the state is now ripe to produce a female governor. The dream will be realised in 2026 with the PDP flaunting its magic wand and displaying its avowed love for gender balancing, unlike the APC. The PDP should come together and start planning ahead of the 2026 governorship election. The coast is clear considering the abysmal failure of the APC at the national level.”  Related News   Hike in drug prices caused by exchange rate dangerous — NMA  You’ll govern Ekiti for eight years, Fayose tells Oyebanji  Afe Babalola advises FG on benefits of residential varsities   
She regretted that some leaders who benefited greatly from the PDP had abandoned the party and were no longer concerned about its survival and return to its winning streak.
Ogun, who assured that she would champion the reclamation battle and become the first female governor in Ekiti State added, “There is a difference between passion for development and personal interest. Some people are only after personal interest and not collective interest. We won’t allow this in PDP again.      
“A party that ruled the country for 16 years and at a time produced 30 out of the 36 governors can’t be said to be a pushover or not well mobilised to win a state like Ekiti. We are on course and we will fulfil this dream.
“I am convinced we are taking over power in 2026. I will be the next governor of Ekiti State and the first female governor in Nigeria. The young generation of PDP should believe that they can sit at the table and eat, rather than depend on the crumbs falling off the tables of leaders that had already seated. This party belongs to all of us”.
The PDP former scribe, who promised to declare her intention to run for the governorship position to the party and Ekiti people at the appropriate time, said, “It is no longer going to be business as usual. The party will now be handed over to committed leaders and not merchants.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/23172640/Funmilayo-Ogun-750x430-1-636x365-1.webp

Diri, who is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, and his reelection campaign team stormed the Ekeremor Local Government Area to woo voters, while Sylva and his APC electioneering train sailed to Southern Ijaw, the local government of his running mate, Joshua Maciver, to seek the votes of the people.
While Sylva berated Diri for spreading hunger and suffering among the residents due to his alleged lack of capacity to govern the state, the incumbent governor criticised the APC standard bearer for maltreating his (Sylva’s) former deputy, Peremobowei Ebebi, and trying to thwart Heineken Lokpobiri’s nomination for ministerial appointment.
Both Ebebi and Lokpobiri, who is the current Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Oil), are APC members and sons of the Ekeremor LGA, which also has Ayamasa as the maternal home of Diri. 
Speaking at Olugbobiri and Oporoma in the Southern Ijaw, where he concluded his campaign in the council area, Sylva stated that he was feeling pity for Diri because the office of governor is bigger than his ability.
The former governor, while addressing the crowds of people, said, “He (Diri) doesn’t understand governance. I feel sorry for him because he took up a job for which he lacks the capacity to do. I’m coming in. I can do the work of the governor more than him.
“You see, if it were something that we would laugh about, I would laugh. But I can’t laugh because people are dying; people are hungry because of the incapacity of the man (governor). And that’s why I came out to correct the situation. I will link up with the Jagaban (President Bola Tinubu) in Abuja. I want to assure you that your lives will never be the same again.”      
The immediate-past Minister of Petroleum Resources said he was running for governor with a well-defined six-point agenda aimed at alleviating the misery of Bayelsans, stressing that they should not endure the consequences of Diri’s ineffective policies and programmes.

But Diri, whose reelection campaign team visited Ekeremor main town and 13 other communities, recalled how Sylva masterminded the impeachment of Ebebi as his
deputy when they were in government, and that he (Sylva) did not support Lokpobiri’s nomination for federal cabinet appointment by Tinubu.
During the event, the governor inaugurated a pavilion at Ekeremor town, a landing jetty at Ogbotobo, a concrete bridge at Lalagbene, internal roads at Aleibiri and Ayamasa as well as a newly-built technical college at Ayamasa.
Addressing the people, he mentioned how he promised to complete the 42.2km Sagbama-Ekeremor road, and expressed gratitude to God that he was able to deliver on the project in less than four years in office, adding that he would carry more developmental projects in the area in his second tenure.
Diri said, “What we have done in Ekeremor is campaigning for us. The roads, pavilion, shore protection, brand new technical college and more are all campaigning for us; unlike those on the other side that did not do anything during their time in office.
 “I promised to complete the Sagbama-Ekeremor road during my campaign in 2019 and I delivered. I promise Aghoro people that the day we inaugurate the Sagbama-Ekeremor road, we will flag off the Ekeremor-Agge road and take over the construction of internal roads.        
 “Sylva removed our son, Ebebi. He also did not want our son, Lokpobiri, to be a minister. He said it should be on hold so that when he fails he can have it. But thank God, today we have Lokpobiri as minister.
“Sylva does not deserve any vote from Ekeremor after his atrocities against the people of the area. Sylva has been rejected by people of the state and even the court has said he is not qualified to be on the ballot.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/03231656/DUOYE-DIRI.jpg

Fayose, who spoke at a special thanksgiving service at Cathedral Church of Emmanuel Okesa, Ado Ekiti to mark Oyebanji administration’s first year in office, said not only will Oyebanji successfully complete his first term, but he would also get reelection for a second term.
Fayose spoke on behalf of ex-governors of the state,  Niyi Adebayo and Kayode Fayemi.
He said, “We are all together for Biodun Oyebanji. I am not a member of your party (APC) and I will not be. I am with you (Oyebanji) hundred per cent. 
“Where is Bisi K (Chief Bisi Kolawole, PDP 2022 governorship candidate)? We are going to support you (Oyebanji). You have come to visit me at my house seven times. You are doing it differently and you will get a different result. This church will pray for you and you will do it (governorship) a second time.”

Bamidele, who represented the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, said, “Governor Oyebanji is entrenching the culture of respect and the culture of performance. He is lucky to have Governors Adebayo, Fayose and Fayemi as mentors and advisers. What he is doing differently is that he is giving the state a new political order, uniting various groups where youths, women, and civil societies consider themselves as stakeholders.
Making his remarks,  Oyebanji said he counted himself lucky to be standing on the shoulders of the former governors, whom he described as “giants”.
“Today is about God in our life as people of Ekiti State.  It is not because I am the best person in the state or because I know how to do it; it’s not because I am the most brilliant, all is by the grace of God. For the little we have achieved, I give God the glory,” he said.

 Nigeria is celebrating its 63rd independence anniversary, how do you think the country has fared in terms of its military strength and advancement over the years?
Of course, the military has come a long way. Don’t forget that at independence, we had just about five battalions in the army but right now we have eight divisions, so it’s a huge growth from what the military was at independence. It is a normal thing anyway because you start small and then grow big along the line. At independence, we didn’t even have our own academy. The Nigerian Defence Academy came into being in 1964, so we now train our officers and that certainly will help us to build bigger and stronger armed forces. Don’t forget that our defence academy is a tri-service one; we produce personnel for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. It’s been a good advancement for the armed forces.
The military defends the territorial integrity of the country, and till date, that integrity has not been violated, except for Boko Haram that at some point took control of some areas in the North. Do you think the military gets the kind of appreciation it deserves? 
There are still a lot of misunderstandings by some parts of the populace who do not understand the role of the military as to be able to appreciate them enough, but in recent times, a good number of Nigerians have shown their appreciation knowing the ultimate price that military personnel are paying with their lives every day. Anybody who listens to the news will hear how many soldiers are dying during encounters with one thing or the other. Nigerians have learnt to appreciate their armed forces better than before.
As a military officer, even though retired, how would you describe the roles played by the military in the early years of Nigeria’s independence?
The military’s intervention in the politics of the nation has its pros and cons. The very first one on January 15, 1966, is the one we can really say started the trouble in Nigeria. When we look at the generation of leaders available, I think they were more prepared for leadership than the subsequent ones. The level of exposure, knowledge and experience they had cannot be compared with the likes of Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Tafawa Balewa, and the Sardauna of Sokoto (Ahmadu Bello) and other leaders that were removed from power then. The true side of it is that some nations like South Korea developed very fast under military regimes. For us, we have not maximised that kind of benefit. Parts of the infrastructural development in Nigeria are still traceable to the military regime and basically, one of the advantages of the military is the low cost of governance. That is inherently so in a military regime because we don’t have the legislature at all. When you think of the cost of running the National Assembly, the state assemblies, and all of that, if those are not there, imagine what you would be saving. Other than that is the fact that military officers are certainly more disciplined in terms of their character cultivation and prudence. Certainly, it is not only because of that. It is because the numbers involved are also very minimal. In the real sense, the number of personnel involved in the military regime is less than five per cent of the military because most of the other players are still civilians. The military just takes the dominant appointments but the bureaucracy is still run by the civilians and a lot of the appointments are even taken by the military. We had some civilian ministers under them at different times so it is not all military. It just happened that the Head of State was a military man at the time and most of the governors were military. Basically, it is not like politics where one minister will bring a whole bandwagon of people to work with him in civilian rule. It is actually under that kind of setting that we should have had accelerated development in terms of infrastructure, industrial development, etc., but we need to do better. When you look at our peculiar environment unlike the experience of South Korea where they were able to accelerate their development so much under a military regime and it was more or less a blessing to them, that is not to say that a military regime is anything to desire. It is still an aberration anyhow and there is no benefit that can be derived from it.      
Many Nigerians blame the military coups for the setbacks the country experienced till date, given the coups in the past. Do you think heaping the blame on the military is misplaced and how does that make you feel?
It is difficult for me to even think of anyone now. The military has left the stage for 24 years now, so should we consider it to be better? The military is part of the Nigerian society. There are peculiarities of the military, some of which give us some advantages and benefits. At least, we have seen the difference between the military and civilian rule. How some of them turn our common wealth into their personal wealth. The difference is clear. In the military, you see a deep sense of patriotism and the willingness to lay down your life than the civilians. That is an eloquent demonstration of extreme patriotism. You can’t take that away from the military and it is common to them anywhere in the world. When you join the military, you know you have the choice of being a business man so you are not expected to be as rich as Aliko Dangote. That means you should know that you are going to live an average life, at least to be able to train your children and get the best of opportunities that come your way.
What lessons can be drawn from Nigeria’s independence?
Independence is a desirable thing for any set of people, but what do we make of independence? We should ask ourselves. Of course, there is something called national pride and sovereignty that will certainly make any nation want to be independent, even if it was not a better option at the time, it wouldn’t really matter. That means you will be in charge of your own destiny, especially for national pride, sovereignty and other things. Thereafter, when you have had independence, you will move forward from there. Of course, it is obvious to everybody that we are better than what we have done so far and the major lesson from there is the rigging of leadership. We have not been able to craft a system that will bring forth the right set of leaders to lead us. It is the quality of leadership that will show how to maximise the benefits of independence. Two major facts that determined how quickly nations got their independence were the quality of leadership and the level of technology. Even before we were colonised, it was also a result of that. Nations, kingdoms and ethnicities that had strong leadership were able to resist the colonisers. It is the same thing if we were begging to get our independence, because when you are given, you can now handle your destiny by yourself.
63 years after independence, insecurity has remained a serious challenge, why has the military been unable to solve this problem?
The challenges we have are not security challenges, instead they are political and we are not ready to call it the real name. We are not addressing it. We are just dodging it and that is part of our problem. Why we have not made much impact is because when you have not defined the problem, how do you solve it?
Does that mean that the insecurity challenge has a political undertone?          Related News   Profiles of the deceased military personnel in Niger crash  Group demands compensation for herders killed in military bombing  Your report false, lacks evidence, FG tackles Reuters    
Of course, I have said it many times. The bandits who are giving us problems, are they Nigerians? How did they get here? Who brought them and are they not known? Is where they came from not known? We are not ready to address the real issue. We are just trying to cut the tree by cutting the branches instead of uprooting it. How long will it take to do that? Until we face the real issue, we are just wasting the efforts of our armed forces. Those who are responsible for the problem know what they are up to, and how they are brought in so if they want to solve the problem, they should start from the root.
Some people have said issues like unemployment, illiteracy and porous borders are the enablers that have to be addressed for insecurity to be a thing of the past, do you agree with that?
In issues like this, we have the root and the remote causes. Yes, all of these can be regarded as remote causes or conditions precedence but they are not the main causes. It is when we want to explain away the real issue that we focus on those ones. That is my position and from what I know, they will tell you about desertification, the Lake Chad is drying up and so on but those are not the main causes.
What is your assessment of the civil-military relationship, given that we still see harmless citizens being harassed by soldiers needlessly?
No, that has reduced drastically. When you take an example of one bad egg somewhere, one cannot use that to generalise the state of things. The average soldier is very respectful, even by their training. Soldiers are the most respectful people we can see because the military itself is respectful but when people are on edge and something triggers them to react wrongly to some impulse somewhere, we see such and that is very scarce. I can see that Nigerians have increasingly become respectful and appreciative of their armed forces. It is known that the members of the armed forces appreciate that and have become friendly with the populace. So far, it is an improvement we can see in Nigeria.
Many military personnel have sacrificed their lives for peace to reign in this country, do you think Nigeria honours its soldiers, either fallen or alive, well enough?
There are standards that are put in place for that. I mean people will always ask for more but the statutory welfare scheme is an administrative provision there but they can be improved upon, no doubt.      
Availability of funds has posed a challenge for military funding, how do you think Nigeria can strike a balance between the need for increased funding and budget constraints?
I have written papers in this direction before. No nation funds its military by just budgetary allocation alone. We have made suggestions about the fact that there should be something like a security trust fund for even defense, research, and development for such specialised institutions. It is a means of increasing spending for the military. No nation will be able to adequately fund its military with just budgetary allocation alone.
Do you think there are milestones Nigeria should have recorded, militarily, since independence that it has yet to, maybe in terms of welfare package, because we hear that soldiers are still poorly paid?
Milestones by the military are set by the military itself, and of course, they will always do that consistently with the availability of funds and the level of technology within the country. The military is part of the society and cannot just advance alone on its own and other sectors are left behind. It doesn’t happen anywhere, so the advancement of any military is always a function of the development of that nation itself in all other things, especially in technological areas.
What do you think Nigeria should do differently for its military before the 64th independence anniversary?
Nobody will even be asking for anything with the state of the nation. What is important now is for the nation to even get a stable economy and become productive so that the naira can appreciate before the military starts asking for anything.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21221824/Major-General-Henry-Ayoola.jpg

 There are divergent views on the ongoing impeachment process against the state Deputy Governor, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, by the State House of Assembly. What is your position on this?
As far as I’m concerned, for now, I’m not a member of the 10th Assembly, but I was a member of the 8th and the 9th Assembly and this similar issue happened during the 9th Assembly and you know the position I took then. I believe what should be uppermost for every individual in Ondo State, most importantly the elected representative, at this time is the development of our state considering the current economic situation we are facing in this country. It should not be impeachment.
This 10th Assembly has just been sworn in not more than three or four months or thereabouts. I discovered that their major assignment is to go and make law and do other functions that are within the oversight, not primarily to go and impeach an elected deputy governor or elected governor. 
However, it is within their power as given to them by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. But to me, at this time, what should concern the members of the Ondo State House of Assembly is the development of Ondo State.
Look at what is happening; the entire state has been neglected. Look at the state capital, Akure. Also, take a look at the neglect, look at refuse everywhere, look at how dirty the state capital is, and look at how the state is neglected. There is no governor and there is no deputy governor. Why is it that what concerned the Assembly now is impeachment? What do they want to benefit from the impeachment? Is that the major reason why they were elected? They were elected primarily to go and make laws that would better the lives of the people who elected them. This is beyond partisan politics.
Are they (House of Assembly members) wrong to begin the process of impeachment following the allegations of gross misconduct against the state deputy governor?      
Gross misconduct is what is entrenched in the Constitution. What is the meaning of gross misconduct? To what extent have they been able to prove gross misconduct? I am not saying it is not within their power to do so, but what I’m saying is that at this particular time when the people are suffering, at this particular time when it is like there is no government in the state, at this particular time when there is no governor in the state, is it the right time for them to say they are now going about impeachment of a deputy governor who is supposed to have been in charge of the government of Ondo State when the governor is not around? I’m not saying it is not within their constitutional power to begin an impeachment process.
At the time, we were aware that they said the deputy governor was involved in fraudulent activity of about N300m through an alleged purchase of a bulletproof car. And at another point, that bulletproof car that they alleged he bought was not included in the allegations levelled against him. What is happening? Who is fooling who?

Are you seeing this as a witch-hunt against the state deputy governor?
For me, whatever way they see it, I’m not been partisan. I’m talking generally as an Ondo State citizen and as a stakeholder. What I’m saying is that this is not the best time for them to go about the move to impeachment the deputy governor. We should ask where our governor is. Who is controlling Ondo State for now? For more than two or three months now, no State Executive Council meeting. Council of States was held in Abuja, and Ondo State was not represented at a crucial and critical time like this. The way they are going, it is like there is something fishy.
 As a former leader of the House, you still have some of your colleagues there. What should they have done on the issue?
We are in a serious mess in this country. When the former deputy governor, Agboola Ajayi, was to be impeached, you remember the role I played. The executive led by the governor concocted unfounded allegations against this man, and when I looked at the allegations, I discovered that the allegations against him were concocted, I said I was dislocating myself and I did, and some other members joined me. The deputy governor couldn’t be impeached. But we cannot get it right in this country until when the legislature is given autonomy.
People are talking about the independence of the judiciary. Where is that independence? People are saying legislature should act separately. Yes, we have three arms of government and the three arms must work separately. Where is that separation? A situation whereby it is the governor who suggests the person that will represent each constituency in an election in his party; tell me, who will now rule that person? Who will dictate to the person?        
Do you think the legislators will succeed with the impeachment of the deputy governor?
I only read on the newspaper and I read on social media. The state Chief Judge has been restrained in line with what I read because I’m not particular and I don’t want to meddle in the affairs of anybody there. But I’m aware in line with what I read in the newspaper and social media that the state chief judge has been restrained from setting up a panel to investigate the deputy governor. When the matter is in court, nobody can take any action until the order of the court is vacated. So, at this point, everybody is in a fixed.
So, what do you think is the way out now?
The way out is that already, parties have maintained the status quo. They are in court; let’s wait till the final determination of the matter in court. But I will be quick to add that to an average Ondo State citizen, more especially to our representatives who we believe can represent us well, they (lawmakers) should do things right and should represent the people well. It should not be about impeachment. By the time they were campaigning, going about telling people to vote for them, impeachment was not part of what they told the electorate that they were going to do. If they told the electorate that they were going there to impeach people, I believe that the majority of them wouldn’t have got the mandate.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21220752/Iroju-Ogundeji.jpg

Some of the Ondo State former lawmakers are opposing the state House of Assembly’s move to impeach the Deputy Governor, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa. What is your position on this as a former principal of the Assembly?
The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended is very clear about the issue of impeachment of the governor or the deputy governor. From my experience, if you can remember, I was in the House of Assembly from 1999 to 2023. I was the deputy speaker then and by the special grace of God, I came back again as a deputy speaker.
When you talk about the supremacy of the constitution, Section 188, sub-sections 1, 2, 3 to 5 state everything. Other former lawmakers who are opposing the Ondo State House of Assembly don’t know what they are talking about. This is a constitutional matter. It is a man-made issue. The same procedure goes for the governor, deputy governor, the speaker, the deputy speaker, the President, the Vice President, the Senate President, and the Deputy Senate President. They are major principal officers, and it has been stated there, and there’s nothing anybody can do about it. They (the Ondo State lawmakers) are following due process. 
Some people are insinuating a witch-hunt against the deputy governor in this matter. How will you react to this?
It depends on the individual. The 1999 Constitution as amended is our Bible. The rules of the House are extracted from the 1999 Constitution. So, whatever is being done in the House of Assembly is basically on Section 1, subsection 1 of the 1999 Constitution.
There appears to be a disagreement between the state Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, and his deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa. Are you not worried about this development?      
We are not the governor; we are not in the executive arm of government. The subject matter is communication. When there is a communication breakdown, you know what it means. From my perspective, you are working under your immediate boss; you can be transferred to any department in your organisation. If you are found wanting, you can be issued a query. At the same time, you should answer the query whether you will be exonerated or indicted. So, that is the procedure.
Let me quickly remind you, (Olusegun) Obasanjo had issues with the Vice President (Atiku Abubakar), this present President (Bola Tinubu), when he was the governor. He (Tinubu) also had issues with his deputy governors. What about Ogun State, Kano, Kogi, and Ekiti states? They had issues with their deputies at one time or the other. So, those are the issues. When some people marry and they cannot go along with one another, they divorce. That is just the principle.  Related News   Ondo Assembly resumes Aiyedatiwa’s impeachment process, demands CJ’s panel  Assembly should be concerned with Ondo’s growth, not impeachment – Ogundeji  Ondo Assembly asks Aiyedatiwa to withdraw suits   
Why is it that many governors have issues with their deputies in Nigeria?
The scripture says look unto God, the Alpha, and finisher of your faith. It said we should run the race with patience. The scripture says we should lay aside the impediment that will not let us get to the Canaan land. There is nothing wrong with being ambitious. You can be ambitious but do not be desperate. I think that is one of the major problems. We are coming to a system where everyone wants to showcase his integrity. We should probably ask some past governors and presidents why it is so.
Are you saying it is the ambition that is causing the problem in Ondo State?
I can’t say that categorically. They said they found him (Aiyedatiwa) wanting. There are some allegations levelled against him; he should answer the query. As I said, when you are issued a query, you should answer the query. The House of Assembly had issued a letter, saying that the deputy governor should answer, but he didn’t answer it, instead, he ran to the court and the court said it doesn’t have jurisdiction over it. So, that is the problem.
You are from the Southern Senatorial District of the state where the All Progressives Congress is tilting towards picking its candidate for the 2024 governorship election. Don’t you think this development would affect the chance of your party in the forthcoming election?        
We have three senatorial districts. The South Senatorial District is just one-third of them. The politicians are not up to 10 per cent of the Ondo State population. The people will determine who will be the next governor based on the aspirant’s pedigree, programmes, and relationship with the people. They will vote for whom they want to vote irrespective of the party affiliation. Is it everyone that will vote for the APC? Have you heard anything from the PDP in Ondo State? Talking about the Labour Party, where are they? By the time we get to the river, we will know how to cross it.
What do you think is the solution to this matter?
The will of God will prevail; there is nothing that is happening that God does not know about. Everything is in the hands of God. I will continue to pray for the state so that peace will reign. There is nothing impossible for God to do. We cannot compare the past with this present time; it is only God that can change the situation.
However, my advice to those in various positions is that they should make sure that loyalty is not 99.9 per cent. Commitment and dedication should be an addendum to loyalty. Loyalty should be 100 per cent and we should also believe that it is God that gives power and can also take power.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21220736/Samuel-Aderoboye.jpg

 Some have said Labour Unions like SSANU, ASUU, and others have been known for embarking on strikes without considering other options as a way to show their grievances. Why is this so?
 Unions have come to stay; they are part of the system and part of our lives. Unions are there to struggle and maintain a good equilibrium for taking charge of the well-being of its members. If for any reason, somebody is saying unions are prone to strikes, it is because the person is selfish, or the person is not fully educated about what we do and how the system was and how it is today. As I said, Unions have always been there even in the most advanced world. Anybody that wants to cite anything good will say, ‘Go to America, France, UK’. In those countries, unions have always been there, making sure that their members are not shortchanged in terms of provisions of welfare by management or employers, and the well-being in terms of other activities the unions engage in such as cooperatives and other schemes.
Strike generally is a product of law, and it is a legal activity. It is in line with the International Labour Organisation law. So, the fact that any union goes on strike does not mean they are breaking any law. The only thing is that there are processes and procedures for going on strike. Again, whenever you hear any union going on strike, especially our union, there must have been a breakdown in communications, or our employers may have reneged on agreements that we have signed with them in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding or Memorandum of Action. 
So, when they renege in the agreement or when deadlines are not respected, what do you expect us to do? We cannot line them up and start flogging them. The only thing we can do is to withdraw our services until the employer listens. In SSANU, we do not emphasise strikes; we go on strike only when it becomes necessary; when our employers put their knees on our necks and we can’t breathe. We have to push them off and look for air. The idea of saying that unions at the universities, especially SSANU or ASUU, go on strike frivolously is far from the truth and not the case.
But many are of the view that incessant strikes by lecturers have negatively affected the standard of education in public universities in Nigeria. Do you agree with that?
 I will not agree with that because it is not always the case. For your information, education is a social service. So, the standard of education is falling because the providers of education don’t provide proper funding. When you don’t fund a system like education properly, you don’t expect to harvest any miracle. When the education system was said to be okay was because it was properly funded. That was when teachers and other workers were trained, lecturers were well paid and their morals high, equipment were available, there was electricity, and our libraries were properly stuck with related books and journals. Hostels were provided, students were comfortable, the clinics were well equipped with drugs, the environment was conducive, security was provided, and our lecture theatres were top-notch with good furniture and other materials. Those are the functions that give you the platform to provide good education or what you now call a high standard. It is not the frequency of strikes or lack of it.      
You can stay a whole section without a strike but if things are not there, how do you expect to have quality education? If you fund education properly, everything will be top-notch. There is no public university in Nigeria today that can tell you it enjoys adequate funding whether in terms of running costs or personnel costs. You find yourself in a situation whereby workers will work, and their salaries are delayed or are not paid. You have so many public universities, especially state-owned universities where you have workers who have not been paid for six months and above. So, the morale is low. If you go to their lecture theatre, laboratories, and classrooms, everything is dilapidated. These are what we can say are the reasons why the standard of education is falling. But I can assure you that if the government is serious about providing quality education, they should make available adequate funding.
 Are you saying the government is responsible for the fallen standard and delivery of quality education and not the union or lecturers?
 Yes, the government is responsible because they call the shots. They employ the workers; they make provisions for the environment to be conducive and they provide equipment and facilities. So, if these things are not there, how will you hold lecturers or unions responsible? As I said, if you see lecturers going on strike, it is because they have been short-changed, and the government has continually shown its inability to respect agreements. Where they have allowances that should be paid or certain things that should be provided and they have agreed with the unions and taken deadlines and such things are not respected, what do you expect? The contribution of strikes to the standard of education is very low; government should be held responsible 100 per cent.
 Don’t you think there should be other ways to make demands from the government other than strike threats?
 Strikes are normally the last resort. If you see a union like SSANU embarking on strike, it means that other ways that you are alluding to have been exhausted. As I said, discussions and negotiations would have broken down and it would have taken a lot of time on the part of both unions and management to have disagreed before you see us going on strike. So, there will always be other ways but strikes are usually the last weapons that unions use to make their demands met. Only in this part of the country do people see strikes as antagonistic activities to the government. It is legal and will continue to happen all over the world.
 The Federal Government said it would grant universities full autonomy in the area of funding. How well do you think this will impact the sector?
 Well, we will wait to see what happens. Any university or union will be happy to see that happen, but we need to also understand the difference between full autonomy in terms of resources and funding and full autonomy in terms of operation. If the government is talking about granting universities full autonomy in terms of funding, it shows that the government will continue to discharge its responsibilities of funding personnel and overhead, and the idea that universities are generating IGR, and they should remit the same to the government should be discontinued and jettisoned. All charges the universities collect are service charges, and in some cases, they get additional funding to make those services available to students.        
We welcome full autonomy in terms of funding but we also welcome full autonomy with full operations. Universities should be allowed to operate without emasculation. Part of the problem we have today is the continued interference of government agencies in the operations of the university. The office of Head of Service of the Federation brings out all sorts of circular undermining the operations of the universities in terms of employment, promotion, and other things. Universities are universal, and our operations are peculiar. So, we should not be subjected to the core civil service operation because if you want to attract the best brain, you must adopt some flexibility in hiring and firing.
You must have the ability to access funds to make certain services available but where you get clearance from certain government agencies before you employ a lecturer, cleaner, or driver, it becomes a problem because they will tell you to go to the Head of the Service to get your vacancies booked; you go to Federal Character Commission, then to the Budget Office, and to the Accountant General’s office, the National Assembly and get you budget passed just to employ university workers. All these are roadblocks to the effective operations of the universities. So, we look forward to having full autonomy in terms of funding, and beyond that, we will be most delighted to have our Governing Councils allowed to function effectively.
When the government came on board on May 29, they dissolved the Governing Councils of universities whose tenure was four years. It is wrong for the government to dissolve university governing councils because they are tenured, and the moment you do that, you have stampeded the progress of the universities because they will not promote, they will not employ, and they will not be able to address critical issues because the council is the highest decision-making body of universities. So, it should not be a pressing matter where you have to announce and behave like you gave a child something with the right hand and take it back with the left hand.
What is your advice to President Bola Tinubu on the formation of the universities’ Governing Boards?
 First, we condemn the incessant dissolution of councils without allowing them to use their full tenure. Meanwhile, if they are to appoint new councils, they should know that university systems are unique, and they should have global standards. The government should only appoint people who know what education is and not appoint politicians as chairmen of governing councils who will be interested only in awarding contracts. Appoint active retired academics and retired university administrators. When such people are approaching an issue, they will be speaking from a point of view of knowledge and not from a point of view of ignorance. Don’t appoint somebody with a diploma or certificate and make him chairman of the council of a university that awards a degree. Those are things that can completely turn the system upside down. So, appointment to the governing council should be based on merit.
Are you in support of those who said the composition of the governing board is enough to handle the affairs of the universities?  Related News   SSANU vows to join proposed NLC strike  Nigeria @63: SSANU demands four months withheld salary  Varsity workers tackle TETFund over suspension of oversea conferences   
 The councils are made up of five external members appointed by the Federal Government and a representative of the Ministry of Education. The job of the representative of the Minister of Education is to report to government activities that are happening in such councils. These people appointed are people of integrity, who have what it takes to run the university system even though we may have some reservations about the appointment into the councils because most cases, you will see politicians being appointed to chair governing councils which has become normal. Therefore, the Office of the Head of Service should have nothing to do with the running of the universities. Councils are appointed by the government with clear representation from all stakeholders; they should be allowed to do their work.      
 There was concern that vice-chancellors were involved in the mismanagement of TETFUND. Are you not worried that this may also happen if universities are granted full autonomy?
 If you understand the operations of TETFUND, vice-chancellors are not in control. What they do is initiate projects and ask for funding from TETFUND. I think that is okay. The most important thing is to ask the important question of what you need in your universities. As long as it falls within the parameters of what the Fund is meant for. The only thing you say is that some VCs over-concentrate on certain areas and neglect other areas within the institution. They always take a special interest in their field. If we have an engineer as a vice-chancellor, you will realise that within his tenure, he will be more interested in acquiring equipment for engineers and neglect other faculties; it is the same thing with others. The system should be more open and transparent, and there should be more stakeholder engagement.
I commend the current Executive Secretary of TETFUND because just last week, we were invited to attend a stakeholders’ meeting and we were encouraged to take an active part in monitoring and evaluation of the projects of the TETFUND. So, the conception of projects in the universities should be more open and vice-chancellors and management should engage with the community for their input. The TETFUND should be encouraged to get the input of union leaders before they approve or fund any project in the institutions. Unions are the last hope of every member of staff in the university as of today.
 There have been issues of mismanagement of funds released by TETFUND in the past as well the irregularity in project delivery. What do you think the Tinubu-led government can do to ensure that the agency effectively serves its mandate devoid of such issues?
 I have some experience in the monitoring of projects by TETFUND. What happens is that the lack of access to such funds is what delays the execution of such projects. If you have had your allocation and you have not fulfilled the requirement of accessing those funds, the money will still be there until you fulfill it. To stem this tide, university management has to be active. They must also engage in a project that is impactful and not projects that will not be usable in five years.
 There have been suggestions for free tertiary education so that the children of the poor can also gain education in tertiary institutions. Do you think Nigeria can afford this considering the current economic realities? 
 Visit your history book, education has never been free. There is always a way you pay for education, but it can be subsidised since it is a social service. The government should not make the masses part with the little they have to acquire education. So, the idea of increasing fees by tertiary institutions is a battle for survival because the government has deviated from its responsibilities of funding the system properly. There is no institution currently in Nigeria that can boast of using only what they get from the government to pay their bills. Some of them are increasing the fees to help them get enough money to run the system. I don’t support the masses extra money just to make provisions for education, government should take its responsibility seriously. Education, housing, water, and security are things the government can provide to make the populace survive. Education must continue to be social services and subsidy must continue to remain in the system.  
 In August this year, the Federal Government insisted on the effective date for the commencement of the implementation of the newly developed Core Curriculum Minimum Academic Standards for the University System. What are your reservations about the new curriculum?
 Curriculum is the key driver for any education system and the development should be the business of institutions. Interference should be minimised so that institutions will not be forced to undertake things they do not have expertise over. So, the idea of having a uniform curriculum is good because the educational system will have uniformity and the product of such institutions will meet the manpower development need in the country. But where you have confusion within the system in the development of curriculum; that is where the problem starts from. We should be able to have specialised institutions that are keen on particular training or expertise but when you allow a university of technology for instance to produce lawyers, then there is clear confusion there. There should be a clear-cut mandate and a curriculum that will not confuse the students.
 Some have argued that what is obtainable in class is different from the realities on the field. Do you think this new curriculum will address that issue?
 This is why I said the development of the curriculum should be handled by people whose job it is to do that. There should be involvement of stakeholders within or without. Developers of our curriculum should be able to consult with the industry. There are new frontiers in almost all professions. Things are changing, the world is fast evolving. You cannot continue to teach people with the same approach or continue to use old facilities and equipment. For instance, institutions teaching medicine should be able to acquire the latest machines available for new ailments affecting the people, the same thing applies to other fields so that our graduates will not look foolish after graduation, and they cannot perform in the industry. There should be a synergy between the town and gown. There should be consultations.
Recently, the Secretary-General of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian Universities, Prof. Yakubu Ochefu, said only 38 women have held the position of vice chancellor out of over 720 individuals. Why do you think this is so?
 I guess he only spoke about what he knows but it is not only peculiar to vice-chancellorship. Since we have had Nigeria, how many female presidents have we had? We have 36 governors and FCT ministers; do we have a single female? The male dominating all our aspects of life is not something new. Has the so-called advanced democracy, America ever produced a female president? So, if we have produced 38 women vice-chancellors, it is still counting, and the numbers are increasing. Twenty years ago, we had only one female vice-chancellor but today, the case is different. It is for the female academics to take up the challenge and the men who are in charge should give a level playing field. We have very good female academics who can make very good administrators. We have the VC of the University of Benin, Professor Lillian Salami. She is doing very well just like all other female VCs.
 There has been an increasing rate of Nigerians leaving the country. What is your take on the development?      
 Immigration has always been part of human history. Even though from time immemorial, people will continue to move from one point to the other, if there is a sudden rise in the number of mass movements of people from the country, it behoves the government to find out what is responsible. They should right the wrongs if these people are leaving because the atmosphere is not conducive and due to the harsh economy. People like me will not go elsewhere and stay there as a foreigner. I have been to many countries, and I can tell you that there is no place like home despite all the inadequacies. There is nothing like freedom. You can leave your house in Nigeria without any identity card and move from one place to another. As long as you look responsible and you don’t look for trouble, nobody will harass you. But overseas, you will have to move around with your passport in your pocket and the fear of being attacked. I will naturally discourage those people from leaving but if they are going to undertake development in their chosen field with plans to come back to contribute to the system, there is nothing wrong with it.
 There had been an embargo on recruitment since the last administration whereas a report revealed that there is a shortage of professors in the university system. What is your take on this?
 You don’t recruit professors; it is promotional, and I doubt if there is any embargo on employment for academic staff. To the best of my knowledge, they have always sorted and got weavers for vice-chancellors to employ members of staff. If that is not the case, even within the eight years of the former President, you cannot tell me that those universities do not have staff. So, the issue of manpower development or relevant members of staff will continue to become issues because the speed at which they established universities is not commensurate with the speed at which staff development is carried out. We will continue to advise the government to make access to education easier.
 Last year, the Federal Government under the former minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, issued a licence to ASUU’s rival unions, the Congress of Nigerian Universities Academics and the National Association of Medical and Dental Academics. What is your take on that decision?
 I don’t want to comment on that because I am not their member. They are in court already. So, discussing the matter is sub judice. In Nigeria, there is freedom of association, but it is not a good development for the system. Already, four unions is a good number but by the time you have six, it is becoming a crowd. What is it that the CONUA people want that is not in ASUU? What does NAMDA need that is not in another union in the university? So, leave the previous government with the politics they played. We all know what happened and the reason they did that. We will wait and see if they will be able to survive and stand the test of time.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21222213/Muhammed-Ibrahim.jpg

Are you confident that INEC can conduct a credible election in Bayelsa State, come November 11?
Yes, I am. The truth is that INEC’s conduct of elections keeps improving with every election, with the adoption of technology and innovations. A noticeable area of this improvement is the verification and accreditation of voters to ensure that only the duly registered person and true owner of the identity of a registered voter can vote. This has greatly eliminated the incidents of vote padding. Added to this is the adoption of transparency in our processes for election result management.
Politicians always mount pressure on state Resident Electoral Commissioners to do the wrong thing in their (politicians’) favour. Have you come under such pressure in the past? 
No, I haven’t. Perhaps they already know that I have zero tolerance for such and have not even bothered. I have also avoided personal access to me unless where we meet at general public events we organise for the political parties and candidates.
Do you think you have what it takes to withstand undue pressure from politicians and not succumb to it?
Well, I understand what my responsibilities as a Resident Electoral Commissioner are. I know the extent of my powers and the limit thereof. I have always stayed within my roles and as such, I am able to fend off any pressure.      
What assurances have you got from the police and other security agencies to ensure that electoral violence is stopped on or before the day of the governorship election?
We have received assurances from the police and other security agencies. Additionally, the police have told us that they expect 27,000 personnel mobilised across the country, to be deployed in the state. That should have a direct bearing on the number of personnel to be deployed to each electoral location from the polling unit to the collation areas.
The INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, has said that the results of the Bayelsa State governorship election would be transmitted electronically; this appears to be contrary to your earlier position that the commission will adopt a manual mode of transmission during the coming election. How will you react to this?
I have never at any time said any such thing. A thoroughly ignorant reporter wrote that falsehood and it got trending. As I have come to realise, many people who comment on this issue have not made an effort to know how the INEC Result Viewing Portal works. So, it was so easy for them to be confused and made to believe the falsehood. For the avoidance of doubts, I have always told the public that the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System device would be used both for the accreditation of voters and to take the snapshot of the polling unit result and upload it on the IReV.
The IReV has come to stay since we first used it in 2020 and we will continue to do that. But the public and commentators need to realise that the IReV is not a collation platform or mechanism, as it merely stores the photographs of polling unit results. The physical copies of the poling unit results are given to political party agents, while the original copy is what is taken to the Registration Areas (also called wards) for collation.
What is your impression about the average Nigerian politician that makes you always be on your guard?
I think the proper thing is for an electoral umpire to realise that his or her job entails neutrality and as such, he should be careful of his interactions and always be on his guard. Added to that is the attitude of many, if not most Nigerian politicians, who want to win all the time and at all costs and see the election as a do-or-die affair.        
Do you think politicians involved in election malpractice should be banned for life from politics? Why?
Every malpractice must be punished with sanction but electoral malpractices require even heavier sanctions, but I do not think that life disqualification is necessary.
INEC in Bayelsa State must have met with stakeholders, including the political parties that will be involved in the elections. What was the kernel of the discussion during the meeting?
I have always stressed the need for the stakeholders, especially the politicians to take steps to understand the provisions of the constitution and the enabling laws and guidelines for the election. I equally want them (politicians) to organise voter education for their members and potential voters. It was embarrassing and shocking that in one of the recent meetings we had, none of the chairmen or representatives of political parties knew how to access the IReV or had ever interfaced with it to know how it works. I had to put them through the process of accessing the portal seamlessly.
Some INEC employees fall into the temptation of taking anti-democratic actions during elections. What message do you have for INEC employees under you?
I have in many ways warned them against acts that are contrary to the law and inimical to the integrity of the electoral process. They also know that there could be negative consequences against them.
How soon do you think Nigeria can develop to the point where qualified citizens living outside the country can also vote during elections?      
That would be dependent on the ability of the country to have a credible database of Nigerians in every part of the world, so as not to affect the integrity of the list of voters.
Local government elections in Nigeria have always been won by the ruling party in each state. Many have always faulted the conduct of such elections by State Independent Electoral Commissions. What do you think is the way forward?
We need a stricter constitutional guarantee that will ensure the independence of the members of SIECs, the practical guarantee of the terms of office of SIECs, and restriction of state houses of assembly from legislating in a manner as to weaken the third tier of government, which is the local government administration.  Related News   Kogi, Bayelsa, Imo elections crucial — INEC  INEC lists 46,084 ad hoc workers for Imo, Bayelsa, Kogi gov polls  Investigators visit Bayelsa oil spill site   
State governors also need to be democratic enough not to meddle in the operations of the local governments or try to pocket them and their resources. This will require the state houses of Assembly not to pass whimsical legislation meant to weaken the local government administrations and make them willing tools in the hands of the state governors.
The delay in the arrival of INEC ad-hoc staff and materials to polling units has been an issue for a long time. Is there a time when this will become a thing of the past?
INEC needs to do more in terms of better preparations ahead of each election, and we promise to do so in this election in Bayelsa State. There is also a limit to what we can do based on the level of infrastructural development in the country, as such a level of development naturally affects logistics.
Some potential voters did not collect their Permanent Voter Cards until the October 9 deadline. What measure did INEC take to ensure they got the items so that they would not be disenfranchised on election day?  
There was adequate information to the public while the cards were available for collection for four weeks. Remember that apart from the local government offices of INEC, we equally took the cards to the wards, where there were more than 500 uncollected cards in such wards. However, given the number of cards that have remained uncollected in many of the local government areas, it may be safe to say that many of the uncollected cards may belong to persons who are dead, no longer in the given location, or may have relocated out of the country.
Vote-buying has always been an issue in the country. How can the menace be stopped?
This is purely a societal problem and a reflection of the cash-and-carry and transactional system of our society. Members of the public see those in government as highly pampered at the expense of society and therefore see the electoral process as a time to exact their monetary demands on them. However, at the centre of this is the realisation by the seller and buyer of the votes that today, the votes count in determining who wins the election, unlike what it was in the distant past where votes were easily padded or inflated.
The riverine areas in Bayelsa State are far from Yenagoa, the state capital, and most times, these areas are volatile during election periods. What is INEC doing to ensure the safety of its workers?
For election security, we rely on security agencies, led by the police. As you know, we have the Inter-agency Consultative Committee on Election Security. It is chaired by the REC and co-chaired by the state Commissioner of Police. We have had meetings where we strategised for the election, taking lessons from previous elections. We have also had meetings with the military forces made up of the Nigerian Army, the Navy, and the Air Force on how to secure the waterways before, during and after the elections. We have also held engagements with some youth groups such as students and community youth groups where we sensitised them about the need for a peaceful election and not allow the politicians to use them for negative conduct that could risk their future.
You were the Resident Electoral Commissioner in Rivers State. While many praised you for doing a good job for the people of the state, some said that you were biased. How will you respond to this?
Yes, I was REC in Rivers State for more than four years and I conducted the 2019 general election there. The first election I conducted there was a bye-election into a state constituency in 2018. Some politicians sponsored violence that disrupted the election in at least 100 of the 142 polling units of that constituency. We suspended the process and eventually, the election was not completed because we did not want politicians taking benefit from their rogue conduct. Our stance shocked many of the politicians and their anger against me started from then.      
I should also mention that in my second tenure as REC, I was posted to Edo State where I conducted the last general election. There, three political parties; the APC, LP, and the PDP won different elections. The LP won the state in the presidential election, such that none of the other parties got up to 25% of the votes in the state. However, for the legislative elections, the three parties won different seats. Interestingly, apart from the presidential election, all three parties complained in different areas where they lost. So, on some days, after the election, the APC, LP, and the PDP took turns to come to our gate to stage protests about where they lost.
What this tells us is that for many politicians and their supporters in Nigeria, an election umpire is only as good as the outcome of the election conducted. If the politician wins, he or she and their supporters will say everything went well and it was a victory for democracy. But if they fail, they and their supporters will accuse the umpire of bias. The job of an umpire in an election in a place like Nigeria is never an easy one, as one gets thrown darts, murk, and hatred. It is worse if you are unflinching or unyielding to the shenanigans of the politicians. That is what I strive to be at all times. Many people will just hate you for upholding the standards. But like I tell some people, these unfair allegations come with the territory.
What is your message to politicians who may be planning to sponsor thugs to disrupt the forthcoming governorship election in Bayelsa State?
I will advise them that there’s life after any election and there are repercussions for every action they take. If in the quest for political power, they are ready to maim and destroy, there is no guarantee that they may not be on the receiving end of such either now or next time. The beautiful thing about Bayelsa State is that it is one of the most ethnically homogenous states in the country. So, the politicians here need to be reminded that the use of violence is injurious to everyone, including their interests.
Some believe that states are militarised during elections when the number of security operatives deployed during elections is huge. Don’t you think the huge number of policemen, soldiers, and Civil Defence personnel should be reduced in order not to scare the electorate from coming out to vote on election day?
It’s a case of choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea. You asked me earlier about our concerns for the safety of the poll officials and I would add the safety of voters and all participants in the electoral process. If we need to have more armed security officials in place to guarantee such safety, then we have to do so, rather than leave the civil populace to be exposed to the attack of thugs and armed criminals who may want to disrupt the elections.
A professor was prosecuted and jailed in Akwa Ibom for getting involved in electoral malpractice. Are you ready to prosecute any ad hoc worker who will go against the law during the forthcoming election?        
If we have enough facts and materials as evidence to sustain such a trial, I would rather that officials do the right thing than wait to be prosecuted for doing the wrong thing.
Recall that during the Anambra governorship election, INEC officials could not get to their polling units on time because of poor logistics. How far has INEC in Bayelsa State gone in hiring buses that will convey ad hoc workers to their polling units on election day?
We have held some meetings with the service providers, based on the MoU signed between the Commission (INEC) and the unions, the National Union of Road Transport Workers and the National Association of Road Transport Owners. We also have similar meetings with the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, to address transportation by boat. Ultimately, the electoral officers who head the local government offices of INEC will have to interface with transporters and ensure that they deliver quality service.
INEC has expressed fear over the rising level of insecurity in Kogi, Imo and Bayelsa states ahead of the forthcoming governorship polls in the three states; how will the Commission navigate or manage the situation, or does INEC intend to postpone the exercise if the situation remains the same.
I have spoken much about the plans for security before, during and after the election. I think that having made all those plans, we should be looking forward to a good election.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21220942/Obo-Effanga.jpg

At the rally were many Igala indigenes, especially members of the Social Democratic Party, Peoples Democratic Party, and the African Democratic Congress, who defected publicly to the ruling APC.
They promised to deliver massively for the APC in the election to pave the way for the continuity of what they described as the detribalised and purposeful leadership of Governor Yahaya Bello, which had brought unity and sincere development to all parts of the state, noting that there was nothing like ethnic agenda in the dictionary of patriotic citizens.
In his remarks, the Director General, Kogi APC Governorship Campaign Council, and Minister of Steel Development, Shaibu Abubakar Audu, said the only agenda for the APC was the Kogi Agenda, adding that the party’s candidate was coming to build on and consolidate on the laudable legacies of Bello. 
“The only agenda for the APC is the Kogi Agenda. The party has the interest of the whole state. Alhaji Ahmed Usman Ododo has a vision for the development of the entire state. He will build on and consolidate the legacies of gov. Yahaya Bello.
“We are proud today that Kogi is the most secure state in north-central Nigeria. The APC will provide massive jobs for our teeming youths through the agricultural revolution. The APC is working on expanding its capacity to be able to produce several agricultural products, particularly in Kogi East.
“I urge you to support the APC and Alhaji Ododo. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who appointed me as Minister of Steel Development, is interested in the vision and success of Kogi State through the development of Ajaokuta Steel.      
“This will enable the provision of massive jobs for the entire youths of our dear state. He has asked that we do not hand over the state to a hustler government or an opposition government. The President is concerned about the state and has said we cannot afford to hand over a strategic state to the opposition,” he stated.
The Chairman of APC in Kogi State, Abdullahi Bello, expressed satisfaction with the massive turnout and enthusiasm displayed by the people of Kogi East and urged them to sustain the tempo to pave the way for a landslide victory in the governorship election.
Also, the lawmaker representing Kogi East in the National Assembly, Senator Jibrin Echocho, called on the people of Kogi East, who had yet to come into the APC fold, to embrace the party, pointing out that elections are won on party structures.
“Let me appeal to our people to be passionate with the APC. Our candidate is marketable. Elections are won based on Party structures. The people of Kogi East voted for APC in the general election. We cannot afford to do otherwise in the forthcoming election.

“Governor Bello has laid a solid foundation in infrastructure, and human capital development across the state. His achievements have played a major part in the election. Let’s all join hands in ensuring collective victory for the APC,” Echocho said.
Addressing the people, the Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Edward Onoja, urged the people of Kogi East to vote on the strength of continuity and cautioned against sentiments, saying that elections are about political parties and not tribe, religion or region.
In his speech, Bello cautioned the people against ethnicity, stressing that tribal politics had no place in this time and age.        
“Ethnic politics is selfish interest. Igala’s agenda is about job creation, development, and prosperity. Don’t be deceived. The APC will win with a landslide. Victory will be ours at the election. Alhaji Usman Ahmed Ododo is a refined gentleman with cognate experience in public service and politics.
“On assumption of office, we met a state divided along ethnic and other fault lines. We have been able to cement all those fault lines. Today, issues of ethnicity have been buried. Fairness, equity, justice have replaced mediocrity, ethnicity.
“We have raised youths and women across the board. We have built and distributed projects, infrastructure and empowerment across the board. So much has been achieved in the state, and we cannot afford to go back to our dark days,” the governor said.
Addressing the unprecedented crowd, the APC governorship candidate, Ododo, said his aspiration was about the people, progress, and unity of the state.
“Let me appeal to the people of Kogi East. Let’s build a united and stronger Kogi State which we all can be proud of. Let this election be about our people, development, unity, and prosperity. It is my fervent appeal that I’m ready to be a servant leader with no barrier,” he said.
The APC governorship candidate thanked Bello for his outstanding achievements and promised to build on the legacies.
While telling Igala people that it would be counterproductive to play ethnic and minority politics, he specifically thanked Tinubu for his outstanding leadership and commitment to the growth and development of Kogi State and Nigeria at large.      
Highlights of the rally were the official welcome of decampees from the PDP, SDP, and other political parties to the APC.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21233207/Usman-Ododo.jpeg

The call came after a meeting of the party’s South-East Zonal Executive, held in Enugu on Friday.
During the meeting, the zonal leadership of the party unanimously nominated the former PDP National Youth Leader, Hon. Sunday Udeh-Okoye as the new party National Secretary.
Briefing journalists on the outcome of the closed-door meeting, the party’s National Vice Chairman, South-East Zone, Chief Ali Odefa, said that the decision to support Anyanwu was a collective one, adding that the party would do its best to ensure its victory at the polls. 
“We have resolved that, as South-East members of PDP, we must all do our utmost best to support our candidate in the November 11 gubernatorial election in the person of Senator Samuel Anyanwu to win. All party members in Imo State are encouraged to put in their best,” he said.

Odefa also said another resolution was passed to nominate Udeh-Okoye as the national secretary of the party to allow Senator Anyanwu to concentrate on his electioneering campaign in Imo State.
“The position of the National Secretary will be a kind of distraction to his electioneering campaign and victory at the polls. Therefore, the South-East Zone, having met and brainstormed, has come up with a nomination from Enugu State in the person of Udeh-Okoye to replace Senator Samuel Anyanwu as the National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party.      
“We shall send our resolutions in writing to the National Working Committee of our great party for ratification on behalf of the National Executive Committee as provided by our party constitution,” he added.
Speaking earlier, the leader of the party in the zone, who doubles as Enugu State Governor, Dr Peter Mbah, urged the party members to remain steadfast and committed to the party.
According to him, the zonal leadership would re-strategise to bring the party back on its feet, assuring that with commitment and unity of purpose, the party would emerge successful at the Imo governorship polls.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/21231554/Samuel-Anyanwu-e1697926553632.jpeg

The party disclosed this in Ochadamu, Ofu Local Government Area of the state, during its ward sensitisation meeting Friday.
The Chief Press Secretary of the state governor, Onogwu Muhammed, in a statement shared on his social media handle on Saturday, highlighted the achievements of Governor Yahaya Bello’s administration, stressing that these accomplishments are more than sufficient to secure another gubernatorial victory for the APC.
He said, “Our party has a stellar track record in Ochadamu ward, and the upcoming election will be no different. Even those who previously stood in opposition to us have now chosen to join our ranks. We are committed to expanding the margin of victory between the APC and the runner-up in the forthcoming election. With our strong presence in the 3,508 polling units and 239 wards across the state, the odds are decidedly in our favor. 
“We proudly count three Senators, six out of nine House of Representatives members, and 24 out of 25 House of Assembly members among our ranks. Given the remarkable performance of the current administration, which has endeared our party to the people, it is all but certain that we will secure a resounding victory on November 11.”  Related News   Quit Bayelsa gov race, PDP tells Sylva  Bayelsa: APC chiefs back Sylva for governor   Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh joins APC, dumps ADC   
It added that a former leader of the People’s Democratic Party from the area, Odu Akowe, defected to the APC.
He expressed confidence that this shift would substantially bolster the APC’s electoral prospects.      
Akowe implored the people to unite in support, stressing the significance of having Joel from Ofu Local Government area as a compelling reason to deliver the APC a victory with a substantial margin.
“We were once on the other side of the aisle, but today, we have wholeheartedly joined your ranks. Together, we will achieve an extraordinary victory on November 11. Ododo and Joel hold special significance for the people of Ofu, and we are unwavering in our commitment to ensuring the party’s triumph,” he said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/01120324/Yahaya-Bello.fw_.png

This was even as the party appealed to the INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, to investigate and address the issue on time.
The electoral umpire had on February 28 declared Ogah as the winner of Isiukwuato Umunneochi Federal Constituency election with 11,769 votes as against the 8,752 votes bagged by Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, who is now the current Minister of State for Labour and Employment.
But a National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Umuahia, Abia State capital had on September 6 nullified the election of the LP candidate representing Isiukwuato Umunneochi Federal Constituency. 
Delivering judgment in the petition tagged EPT/AB/HR/8/2023 on Wednesday in Umuahia, a three-member panel of the tribunal ruled that Ogah did not comply with the provisions of the Electoral Act.
Ogah argued that the acceptance of the ministerial appointment of Onyejeocha as minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was a clear sign that she had abandoned her petition.
But the tribunal in its ruling dismissed the submission of the lawmaker.      
Confusion, however, arose on Thursday when two legal practitioners showed up, each brandishing a letter of authority to speak on behalf of INEC, when the case came up for hearing in Lagos, the venue of the Appeal Court.
The drama has forced the leadership of the Labour Party to write a letter titled, “Open letter to INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on the show of infamy and dishonour by the commission in election appeal held in Lagos”, to the commission’s chairman, pleading with him not to scuttle the appeal of its candidate.  Related News   Kogi, Bayelsa, Imo elections crucial — INEC  INEC deletes Sylva from Bayelsa gov candidates list  Court cases affecting plans for Kogi, Bayelsa, Imo polls – INEC chair   
Reacting at a press conference on Friday, the National Publicity Secretary of LP, Obiora Ifoh, also read out the letter and described the incident as a deliberate act by the commission to frustrate their effort at reclaiming Ogah’s mandate.
He said, “Mr Chairman Sir, we, therefore, bring to your notice an ugly incident that happened yesterday October 19 at Lagos State, venue of the Appeal Court on case No. CA/OW/HR/AB/06/2023 between the Labour Party candidate, Hon. Amobi Ogah, who is the plaintiff and the All Progressives Congress candidate, Nkiruka Onyejeocha, who is the respondent. INEC is also a respondent in that matter.
“What played out yesterday was unbelievable hence we call on you to nip the development in the bud to avoid a messy situation. INEC had engaged a Senior Counsel, J.O. Asoluka (SAN), as its lawyer with a letter of authorisation to represent the commission. But at the commencement of the hearing at the Appeal Court, another lawyer surfaced with a letter of authority to take over the case of the same INEC without prior notice to J.O. Asoluka (SAN), that the new counsel had been engaged. They also did not see any need to inform the plaintiff of the development as required by law. When the matter thus came up, a squabble ensued between the two counsel as to who had the authority of INEC to represent it in the case.
“Mr Chairman Sir, it has now dawned on us that the change of legal guard without properly notifying the interested parties was carefully orchestrated by the commission in an alliance with our opponents with the intention to stall proceedings at the Court of Appeal and frustrate our candidate’s appeal that was due for hearing on Thursday.”
An emotional Ifoh disclosed that they were even more embarrassed to observe some expelled LP members, who had joined the Lamidi Apapa-faction fraternising with members of the ruling party at the court.        
The LP spokesman stated that the sight made them start suspecting the court drama must have been stage-managed to embarrass their candidate.
“We are raising this alarm because time is of the essence, even though, the collaborators achieved their intentions as the appeal could not be heard and was adjourned by the court to enable INEC to put its house in order and determine who of the two counsel, has her authority to represent her in the appeal.
“We are therefore using this platform to urge you (INEC chairman) to investigate the inglorious roles which the legal department of the commission is playing and sanction erring officials. The role of INEC in this matter is simply to defend the outcome of the election which it conducted and on which it declared Hon. Amobi Ogah as the duly elected candidate to represent Isikwuato/Umunneochi Federal Constituency in the National Assembly.
“The commission must reject any semblance of compromise. Nigerians are still looking up to it to redeem its image, the aftermath of the controversial 2023 general elections. It must not allow a few pliable members of the Commission to further taint the integrity of the commission,” he stated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/22130749/Labour-Party-1.jpeg

He said the coast was clear for Diri and his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, declaring that they were sailing to victory on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party.
Dickson, who had not participated in the governor’s second tenure campaigns since it started three weeks ago, spoke on Wednesday in his Toru-Orua country home in the Sagbama Local Government Area when he hosted Diri and his campaign team.
A statement on Thursday by Diri’s Chief Press, Mr Daniel Alabrah, said the ex-governor threw his weight behind his successor and expressed conviction that the second tenure of the governor would be successful. 
 “I congratulate the Director-General of the Diri governorship campaign and his team for doing a good job by galvanising the base of our party.
“I can see that the coast is clear. From the eyes of an experienced hunter, l can see that your current hunt will be very successful,” the statement quoted Dickson to have said.
Dickson said the visit by Diri showed that the governor had not forgotten where he started his political journey.        Related News   Diri, Sylva woo Bayelsa voters  Bayelsa polls: Stop taking Dickson's credit, Sylva knocks Diri  Diri's first tenure impressive, says PDP zonal committee    
“When l endorsed Senator Diri in 2019, all hell broke loose; but today, l am very happy that the Diri they said l imposed on them has become a good product for Bayelsa,” he added.
“The visit of the governor and his entourage demonstrates that a man who starts hunting in the thick forest, started from somewhere and this visit shows that he had not forgotten the road from where he got into that thick forest,” Dickson said.
In his remarks, Diri appreciated Dickson for his support over the years and dispelled any rumours of a rift between them.
“For the benefit of anybody who is in doubt about the relationship between Senator Dickson and me, l want to make it clear that there is no rift between us. I am sure beyond reasonable doubt that he is with me.
“What we are doing is to continue to expand our family. All those who were in our family that left, we have brought them back and they are all moving with us. So, this has become a movement. It has gone beyond a political contest. Anywhere we go, it is this organic support that we receive,” Diri said.
The governor also thanked the King (Pere) of Tarakiri clan and the people of Bayelsa West Senatorial District, adding that he was sure of victory in the zone on November 11.
At the event, a minute silence was observed in honour of the late Ekeremor PDP Caucus chairman, Chief Thompson Okorotie.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20021750/Douye-Diri-Seriake-Dickson.jpeg

The 30-year-old federal lawmaker, at a stakeholders’ meeting he organised on Thursday to give an account of performance within four months in office and to fulfil his electioneering promises, said that the best thing that would happen to the state presently was to have Uzodimma reelected as the governor of the state.
Amadi said that the governor had done well in infrastructure, provision of jobs, prompt payment of salaries and pensions, and lifting of the education, health and agricultural sectors, among others.
The youthful lawmaker said that among all the governorship candidates, Uzodimma had more capacity and experience to move the state forward. 
He said that the governor was doing well to tackle insecurity and deepening democracy in the state.
To support Uzodimma’s reelection project, Amadi donated 14 branded sienna vehicles to coordinators across the federal constituency, saying that the biggest project was to have Uzodimma reelected as governor on November 11.
He said that the electoral ward in his federal constituency that delivers the highest number of votes for the All Progressives Congress at the November 11 governorship election in the state, would have the Zonal Intervention Project worth over N100m captured in the federal budget cited in that ward.      
He said “Please vote for the governor come November 11 governorship election in Imo State. Our governor has done well in his first tenure in office. He has done well in job creation, provision of infrastructure, tackling of insecurity and lifting our major sectors like education, agriculture, health and tourism.

The lawmaker also rewarded electoral wards and voting units that gave him the highest number of votes during his election last February and March
He provided brand-new motorcycles to each of the wards in the federal constituency which gave him the highest number of votes in the last National Assembly election.
The wards in Mbaitoli Local Government Area included: Amaike, Ezinihitte, Ogbaku, Afara/Eziama, Ogwa 1 and 2, Orodo A and B, Umunoha/Azara, Ifekala, Ubomiri and Umuagwu/Umunwaoha.

The lawmaker also gave out two Sienna vehicles to each of the wards of the local governments that polled the highest votes.
In her remarks, the deputy governorship candidate to  Uzodimma, Mrs Chinyere Ekomaru noted that she was surprised to see a lawmaker fulfilling his promises within the shortest period in office.

The government specifically admitted that it was facing enormous challenges and revenue deficit which has compelled it to manage to pay salaries.
The Minister of Budget and National Economic Planning, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, represented by the Director (International Cooperation), Dr. Sampson Ebimaro, stated these in Abuja during the 30th Annual Development Forum organised by Life Above Poverty Alleviation in Abuja with the theme, “The role of non-state actors in national development: A case study of LAPO.”
The PUNCH reports that the event was also attended by a former acting Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Sarah Alade; a political scientist and lecturer in the Department of Political Science, Federal University, Otuoke, Dr Felix Oriakhi; and Founder/CEO, LAPO Group, Dr Godwin Ehigiamusoe. 
Ehigiamusoe said, “With millions of beneficiaries and a full-time staff of 10,212, these institutions and others within the LAPO system have made immense contributions to national development. This paper is expected to highlight the over N1.2 trillion LAPO Microfinance Bank has contributed to female owners of micro and small businesses.”
The minister said since the United Nations was very careful in crafting the name, of non-state actors, he would prefer to use the name Non-Governmental Organisations because NSAs could be gorilla or terrorist groups.
“Essentially, NGOs existing cover the space not covered by the government by seeking propositions on issues such as health care, environment, economy, public policy, empowerment and support to vulnerable citizens. The policy objective of government is very critical for both state and non-state actors like the NGOs.      
“The role of NGOs is to work with the government through its national development plan. The chairman has already mentioned and talked about our national development plan for 2021 – 2025. In doing that, the actors have to be very inclusive in the sense that it has to be non-selective and non-discriminatory and you must stick to the overall needs of various areas of the society.
“Government faces enormous challenge especially now, the government is facing revenue deficit. There’s no money anywhere in the country, the government is just managing to pay salaries. The growth rate is very slow and the population growth is fast pacing and increasing. unemployment is surging amid high inflation. These are issues which non-governmental organisations must take on board in helping government to cover the space government could not cover”, he noted.
Alade who was also Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari, on Finance and Economy, said government should collaborate with NSAs to achieve economic development and ensure the success of its social investment programmes.
She said NSAs, including LAPO, would play crucial roles in shaping the economic destiny of Nigeria.  Related News   Govt should adopt partnership for economic growth, says ex-CBN boss  MURIC begs Tinubu to repair Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway  FG suspends N-Power, probes disbursement of funds   
Alade said that the estimated cost of the National Development Plan (2021 – 2025) stands at N348 trillion, with the government contributing N49.7 trillion and the private sector providing approximately N298 trillion, which accounts for about 86 per cent of the total required amount.
Alade said the involvement of non-state actors in the Federal Government projects was necessary.
She said, “It is imperative to recognize why non-state actors, such as LAPO, should align with the national development agenda. The Nigerian National Development Plan emphasizes the crucial importance of such alignment, particularly given the substantial financial commitment required to achieve our nation’s developmental goals.        
“This plan outlines ambitious objectives across various sectors, including infrastructure, healthcare, education, and poverty alleviation. To realize these objectives, a significant financial commitment is essential.
“The government alone cannot shoulder the immense financial burden required to meet these targets. To put it in context, the estimated cost of the National Development Plan (2021 to 2025) stands at N348 trillion, with the government contributing N49.7 trillion and the private sector providing approximately N298 trillion, which accounts for about 86 per cent of the total required amount.”
“A country like  Nigeria, which relies on food and energy imports, she said, would require the role of non-state actors including LAPO, to assist in developing solutions to overcome barriers in the country’s supply chain operation.
“It is essential to recognise that the participation of NSAs in all aspects of national life is crucial for sustainable progress. While private sector economic leadership is indispensable, NSAs should also address social challenges, including inequality, the digital divide, and the need for substantial investment in human capital.
“By promoting inclusive growth and workforce re-skilling, NSAs can contribute to a functional and competitive society.”
Other speakers were unanimous in their position that there should be a partnership between the government and the non-state actors in social economic development if the federal government policies to lift 133 million people out of poverty must achieve the desired objective.
They also called on non-state actors to bring their ideas forward to government from conceptualisation, execution and implementation for proper guidance and support.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/12104948/1Abubakar-Atiku-Bagudu.jpg

Last January, the Deputy Special Representative, United Nations Secretary General of West Africa and the Sahel, Madam Giovanie Biha, reiterated the commitment of the United Nations to democratic consolidation in Nigeria. 
The affirmation was during a peace accord organised for the various gubernatorial candidates in Kano state by the Kano Peace Committee, before the governorship election of March 18.
“The evaluation and observation of the democratic process is a very serious issue that requires every serious political party to listen and suggest ways of deepening our democracy.
“Our democracy has shifted from being nascent to full-fledged democracy and sharing ideas from experiences United Nations agencies like yours have gathered from other developed countries will help developing nations like Nigeria to deepen our democracy,” he said.      
Earlier in her remarks, the leader of the three-member team, Yuen Ho, said they were in the country as part of their oversight duty in the West African region and the Sahel on peace and security concerns.
She said that they were at the NNPP secretariat to get the party’s leadership feedback on their engagements with UN agencies during the period of the 2023 electioneering.
“Our office has the responsibility of providing oversight for different UN programmes, activities and offices with the aim of serving accountability and lessons learned in the processes. So our focus is on the work and the support of UN and how well they have addressed the need of the government in countries they work in,” she noted.
She further revealed that they were in Nigeria to meet with important stakeholders such as the NNPP to find out how the party has engaged with UN agencies on election-related matters and the challenges the party has faced.
“What are your views or collaboration, What are some of the challenges perhaps that you faced, you have received any support or are you further seeking another support that could be strengthened? And to hear your thoughts on how perhaps this collaboration could be improved as we go down the track.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/14071403/NNPP.jpg

Ogene said the step became necessary in order to prevent a total breakdown of law and order in the community, adding that officials of the agency have been conducting themselves in a very violent manner in the name of collection of sanitation levy, describing their activities as “illegal and violent”.
The lawmaker, in a statement made available to journalists on Thursday, stated these after receiving a protest letter from the leadership of the Okpoko community, over their recent harrowing experiences in the hands of agents of the government agency.
He also said that the state government, should also, in clear terms, address the contentious issue of the 2021 and 2022 sanitation levy in the area, so as to conclusively resolve the disagreement and avert a looming security danger in Okpoko. 
The protest letter by the leadership of Okpoko community, the most populated area in Ogbaru Federal Constituency, was presented after a massive protest by residents of the community, who accuse ANSEPA of illegally and violently demanding 2021 and 2023 sanitation levy, which they said the government had already “taken care of,” seemingly during the last governorship campaign period in the state.

Narrating their ordeals in the letter, the Okpoko community disclosed that ANSEPA employs the services of daredevil thugs who often besiege the community at odd hours of the day – sometimes, as early as 4 am – armed with cudgels and wood, going from house to house to terrorise residents, beating and maiming those who fail to pay the alleged illegal levy.
Ogene said, “Such cruel approach to revenue collection is condemnable and ought not to be encouraged in a democracy and any civilised society.      
“While I am not against revenue generation by government, such activities should be undertaken in a legitimate, civilised, peaceful and fair approach that would not threaten the peace of the people.
“I, therefore, call on Soludo to urgently call ANSEPA management to order, especially the contractor responsible for the collection of levy from Okpoko and Ogbaru Local Government Area in general, in order not to ignite crisis and bad blood between the community and government agencies, that may potentially engulf the state.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/19192649/Anambra-State-Governor-Prof.-Chukwuma-Soludo-2.jpeg

The fine covers for 2007 to 2017.
However, the Tribunal absolved the telecommunication firm from paying the sum of $21,039,807, as penalties and interest on the principal sum.
A five-man panel led by Professor A. B. Hamed, gave the verdict and order on Friday, while delivering judgment in an appeal numbered TAT/LZ/VAT/075, filed by the telecommunication company against the request by the FIRS to pay the default. 
Other members of the panel were P. A. Olayemi, Babatunde Sobamowo, Samuel N. Ohwerhoye and Terzungwe Gbakighir.
The facts of the matter according to the processes filed before the appeal, was that sometime in May 10, 2018, the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation issued a report of its investigation into the MTN’s Forms A and M transactions. The report covered the 2007 to 2017 accounting years.
But, in a revised report dated August 20, 2018, the OAGF adjusted the alleged outstanding in respect of import duty and VAT to the tune of N242.2 bn, (Form M -visible transactions) whilst the section relating to VAT and Withholding tax (WHT) was revised $1.284 bn (Form A invisible transactions).      
The processes also stated that sometime in mid-2020, the FIRS informed MTN that it had received a report from the OAGF in respect of its alleged liability to VAT and WHT.
FIRS consequently conducted a review of MTN’s tax and accounting records and upheld the OAGF’s alleged tax liability.
However, MTN and its tax consultant, KPMG Advisory Services, held a series of meetings with FIRS to resolve the tax dispute arising from MTN’s alleged tax liability.
Thereafter, in July 2021, the FIRS issued a VAT assessment of $93, 590, 366m to the MTN. This assessment comprised the sum of $72, 551, 059m, as the principal liability and $21,039,807m, for penalties and interest on the principal sum (first assessment).
MTN objected to the first assessment whereupon the FIRS further reviewed the assessment. Accordingly, by the Notice of Assessment dated April 14, 2022, the Respondent issued a revised assessment for US $135,697,755m to MTN as a revised assessment.  Related News   
Although the principal amount of tax alleged to be outstanding and due from the Appellant (principal tax liability) in the revised assessment, i.e. $47, 776, 210m, was less than the alleged principal tax liability contained in the first assessment, i.e., $72,551,059m, the interest and penalty imposed by the FIRS on the alleged principal tax liability in the revised assessment, i.e. $87.900m, is higher than the interest and penalty imposed by the FIRS on the alleged principal tax liability in the first assessment, i.e., US $21, 039,807m.
Also MTN by a letter of notice of objection dated May 13, 2022, objected to the FIRS’s revised assessment, and FIRS by a letter dated June 16, with ref. no. FIRS/TID/LOS/2020/0213/01, notified the MTN of its refusal to amend the revised assessment.        
Dissatisfied with the FIRS’s amended revised assessment, MTN filed the Appeal before the Tax Appeal Tribunal.
Upon reviewing all the processes filed by the parties, the tribunal distilled five issues for determination, which were; “Whether in view of the clear and unequivocal provisions of the VAT Act prior to the amendment by the Finance Acts, the provision of software licensing and upgrades qualified as a taxable supply of goods and services.
“Whether the provision/lease of bandwidth capacities by Intelsat Global Services & Marketing Ltd, a non-resident entity, through transponders located in the satellite, qualifies as a taxable supply of goods and services.
“Whether in the absence of the production of any false or untrue document or statement by the Appellant, the Respondent has authority to conduct a tax investigation beyond the 5-year restriction.
“Whether training provided by offshore facilitators outside of Nigeria is liable to VAT in Nigeria.
“Whether the Respondent acted in error when it calculated and imposed interest and penalty on the Appellant’s alleged non-remittance of VAT liabilities, the said liabilities having not become final and conclusive.”
While counsel to MTN urged the tribunal to determine the issues in its favour, FIRS counsel, who includes: Abu Ocheme Director Legal FIRS, Egodi Adedeji and Moses Ideho, urged the court to dismiss the MTN’s appeal, and determine the issues raised in FIRS’s favour.      
The tribunal, after taking arguments on the parties, resolved issues one to four in favour of the FIRS, and issue five was resolved in favour of MTN.
The tribunal after perusing all the processes filed by parties, and citing a plethora of authorities held that: “In the final analysis, it is the decision of the Tribunal that issues one to four discussed above are all resolved in favour of the Respondent and the appellant is therefore ordered to settle the assessed liabilities accordingly.
“However, issue five in relation to penalty and interest is resolved in favour of the Appellant and is therefore set aside by this Honourable Tribunal. This is our Judgement.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/18024056/MTN-new-logo-e1663465256894.jpg

Speaking at the 3rd Biennial International Confer...,"<span class=""post-date"">25th October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/nigeria-among-biggest-victims-of-energy-transition-appo/,  Okechukwu Nnodim,"Nigeria and its African neighbours have been described as the biggest victims of the speedy energy transition being championed by the developed world.
Speaking at the 3rd Biennial International Conference on Hydrocarbon Science and Technology, organised by the Petroleum Training Institute in Abuja on Monday, the Secretary-General, African Petroleum Producers’ Organisation, Omar Farouk, said the nations of Africa were being coerced to stop the exploration of fossils.
He, however, pointed out that Nigeria and other nations on the continent, owe their people a duty to utilise the abundant oil and gas resources in their various domains for the development of their economies.
APPO is the African inter-governmental oil and gas organisation with 18 member countries. 
Commenting on the theme of the conference, which was, ‘The Future of the Oil and Gas Industry: Opportunities, Challenges and Development,’ Farouq stated that “we (APPO) very often receive enquiries about the future of oil and gas.”
He said, “It is obvious that the biggest victims of a speedy energy transition shall be the developing countries, especially those from Africa.
“This is because, should the anticipated technological breakthroughs in renewable energy research and development fail to materialise by the time they are expected to be fully deployed, and at the same time the oil and gas industry has been abandoned, leading to a shortage in global energy supplies, the little energy that is available shall be cornered by the rich countries.      
“Even if Africa is able to produce oil and gas, their final destination is going to be where the purchasing power is highest, just like it has been happening since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war.”  Related News   Oil-producing African countries to meet in Nigeria October 25  APPO lauds Nigeria for local content development  Osinbajo urges African economies to look beyond oil revenue   
The APPO official stated that a major study conducted by the organisation a couple of years ago on the Future of the Oil and Gas Industry in the Light of the Energy Transition, identified three imminent challenges that the energy transition posed to the African oil and gas industry.
“These are funding, technology/expertise and markets. The study noted that in the nearly 100 years that Africa has been producing oil and gas, our countries have been heavily dependent on foreign funding, foreign technology and to some extent expertise and foreign markets.
“The study further noted that while the world is committed to a speedy energy transition, Africa owes its people a duty to utilise its abundant oil and gas resources to provide them energy, which is the most potent catalyst for socio-economic development. In other words, Africa must create a future for the oil and gas industry,” Farouq stated.
According to him, the developed world now believes that oil and gas have no future in the contemporary world.
“Because of this belief, members of this school strive, through various policies and actions, to discourage investments and research in oil and gas. At the same time, they work to promote the growth of renewables through huge investments in research and development.
“A defining characteristic of this group is that it is made up mostly of the economically and technologically developed countries of the world, countries that, in the last 150 years, contributed the vast majority of the emissions that we are today told constitutes an imminent climate catastrophe for us and future generations,” Farouq stated.        
In his address at the conference, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Oil), Heineken Lokpobiri, charged participants at the gathering to come up with solutions to address the problem in the Nigerian oil sector regardless of the global push against fossils.
“You must be able to come up with technologies that we need to address our local and peculiar problems in the industry. I’ll be the assessor of the document that will be put together at the end of this conference, so as to ensure that we get solutions for this sector,” he stated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/25030233/nn.png

Obasanjo begged the government to do all her possible best to protect local production of adire from the imported Chinese adire and all other things that could be produced locally in the country.
The elder statesman who made the appeal in his opening speech on Monday in Abeokuta, the state capital at the  ‘Canada Trade Mission ‘24’ pre conference session, lamented that the materials – clothes, for producing Adire that were hitherto sourced in Kano, Kaduna and Ado-Ekiti are not available anymore.
The programme was organised by Solteque Nigeria Ltd where Realtor Babatunde Adeyemo of the Pelican Valley and Mrs Oluwatosin Oloko, Permanent Secretary Ogun State Ministry of Culture & Tourism among others were also guest speakers. 
Obasanjo therefore appealed to the FG to revive the nation’s textile industries in order to make the raw materials for Adire production available for local manufacturers.
He also made case for the establishment of formal training institution where people would learn how to produce Adire and be certified at the end of their learning period.
He said, “I want to appreciate the Traditional rulers who attend this event, you have shown that you are real custodians of Culture. People are saying China want to bastardise our Adire product, if not that we don’t value what we have. I want to commend Ogun State government for the initiative of Oja Itoku for Adire market.

“The clothes for the production of Adire is in Nigeria where they used to buy it in Kano, Kaduna and Ado-Ekiti but there is nothing like that anymore. If we want to produce Adire, where would we get the clothes to produce it? What we have to do is that, the Adire sellers, manufacturers and those who promote it, let us join our hands together. What government needs to do for us is not much. The first thing the government need to do for us is the revival of Textile industry, let us beg them to do that for us.
“Second one is the formal training institution where people will be learning how to produce Adire and get certified at the end of the period of their learning. Let us beg government to do all their possible best to protect our local production of Adire so that Chinese will not have access to bastardise it for us.
Also speaking, the Chief Executive Officer of Pelican Valley Nigeria Limited, Dr. Babatunde Adeyemo, emphasised the potentials of real estate business as a vehicle to attract Nigerian investors living abroad, improve nation’s foreign exchange and also the Internally Generated Revenue base of Ogun State through direct assessment taxes of investors, and jobs and wealth creation for present and future generations.
Adeyemo said, “I want to show you the opportunity in the real estate investment. This is an avenue for you to see someone who have successfully invested in Real estate and want to exhibit it to enlighten and motivate others. God gave me the privilege to start real estate business with modest amount of money and also gave us opportunity to be known in Ogun, Nigeria and globally.
“One of our clients is the convener of this event. Our relationship with him is what brought him back to Nigeria, after he had bought the land and built his home in our Estate, he was convinced to come back home. He established company and also brought the initiative of this event in order to help his people, and not only him.”
According to him, we have been able to drag over 400 Nigerians in Diaspora back home. From his own camp, (Manitoba) they are close to 100 people that have bought land from us.
He explained that as we want to export Adire, we don’t really know that real estate is one of the areas that is really explorable, Real estate is something that people can also take advantage of and export to bring more development to Ogun State and Nigeria in general.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/19183303/Olusegun-Obasanjo.jpg

Commencing with a schedule of three weekly flights, this air link aims to bolster connectivity and facilitate travel between the two countries.
A crop of Nigerian pilots flew in the aircraft from Entebbe to Lagos.
In order to make the Nigeria-Uganda route more open, and accessible for passengers to and from East and West Africa and beyond, two other cities in Nigeria, Abuja and Kano, have equally been approved as entry points for Uganda Airlines by the Nigerian government under the Bilateral Air Services Agreement between both nations in the spirit of Single Africa Air Transport Market. 
The launch of flight services to Lagos by Uganda’s national carrier, Uganda Airlines would help to close the gap in the travel needs of travelers from West Africa and East Africa, while equally affording connections between the two regions of the continent to the world.
The flights will be taking place on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays and the flight will take under five hours. A return ticket for Economy class will be US$ 510 and Business class at $1800.
Uganda’s High Commissioner to Nigeria, Ambassador Nelson Ocherger expressed joy over the inaugural flight of Uganda Airlines to Lagos, saying the approval by the Nigerian government would open a vista of business opportunities to both nations.        Related News   Uganda opposition leader Bobi Wine arrested, says party  Medical staff desert hospitals as Nigerian doctors flood Egypt, Uganda, others  Uganda police foil bomb attack on church   
He said, “The importance of air transport underscores the promotion of trade and investment and it gives Africa the opportunity to leverage on all AU agenda. We thank the Nigerian government for the necessary approval needed to do this operation.”
Ocherger disclosed that his country through the Uganda Civil Aviation Academy has entered into a partnership with the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology, Zaria to train Ugandan pilots, engineers, and other aviation professionals.
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar who was represented by Director of Airport Protocol in the Ministry, Ambassador Oludare Folowosele said, “It is ridiculous to go to Europe before connecting two African neighbouring countries. What we are doing today would lead to wealth creation, shortening of travel time from one country to another rather than depend on Europe all the time for flight connections.”
The journey for Uganda Airlines to commence flight services to Nigeria, it would be recalled, started on 9th October 2002 in Kampala, Uganda when the two respective Ministers of both countries responsible for Civil Aviation initiated an Air Services Agreement with the ultimate desire of bringing about a direct flight from Entebbe, Uganda to Lagos, Nigeria.
This was further reviewed on January 21st, 2005 with certain provisions. It was a matter of concern that the ASA was never operationalised until October 19th, 2023 with Uganda utilising the designated airline from her side to commence the flight operations.
Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN) who was represented by Director of Air Transport Management in the Ministry, Hassan Ejibunu, stated that aviation remains the best way for Africa to connect her people and promote inter-Africa business in line with Africa’s 2063 Agenda, as championed by the continent’s leaders.
Keyamo said, “Aviation has a huge market that should be explored by indigenous African Airlines, as no other Nations can develop the aviation sector for us, except us, Africans. We need to do this in the interest of our over 1.37 billion people, which is 17.4 per cent of the world’s population. I wish to, therefore, challenge Nigeria’s local airlines to seize the opportunity to start operating regional and continental flights to make SAATM and YD achieve their aims, as envisioned by African leaders.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/25015919/Uganda-Airlines.jpg

It said the plan, in line with Section 14 (3) of the VAT Act, was part of moves to reach projected earnings from VAT revenue in the coming years.
VAT is a 7.5 per cent consumption tax administered by the Federal Inland Revenue Service when goods are purchased and services are rendered, and borne by the final consumer.

According to the 2024-2026 Medium Term Economic Framework, the sectors which include telecommunications, banks and other financial institutions and companies in the construction, aviation industry will be added to tax net currently limited to Ministeries, Department and agencies and Oil and Gas Companies.
The fiscal policy also projected an average collection of N35tn in 2024, to N40tn in 2025, and N45tn in 2026, after adjusting exemptions, zero-rated items and include companies whose turnover falls below the N25m threshold.
According to the document obtained from the Budget Office of the Federation, a new law enabling the Federal Inland Revenue Service to appoint anyone as its agent to withhold, collect and remit VAT to its VAT agents would aid the new policy in ensuring smooth payments of taxes and achieving non-oil revenue targets.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/08001235/Tax.jpeg

Section 64 of the Insurance Act 2004 provides for insurance of buildings under construction. Section 64 (3) also provides the penalty for failure to insure any building beyond two floors, with a fine of N250, 000.00 or imprisonment for three years or both.
Speaking at the two-day National Insurance Conference 2023 in Abuja, the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, who was represented by Darlington Nwokocha, the Minority Whip of The Nigerian Senate, noted that statistics showed that about 553 buildings have collapsed in the last 49 years in Nigeria.
He added that the “The fine of N250, 000 for buildings of more than two floors is not adequate enough.” The Senate president in his written speech stressed the need to review the Act for stiffer punishment against any defaulters when it comes to insuring buildings. 
He added, “Whenever a building collapsed, it does not just result in loss of the building but loss of lives, livelihood and infrastructure that would not be replaced without insurance solutions.”  Related News   Building collapse: Victims’ families, survivors lament over compensation  Building collapse: SON calls for stiffer penalty on offenders  Building collapse: NGO demands probe into rehiring of sacked Lagos workers

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr Tajudeen Abass, also decried losses due to building collapse in the country.      
Abass, represented by the Chairman, House Committee on Insurance and Actuarial Matters, Ahmed Jaha, said the conference should ensure there is succour for victims of building collapse.

He said, “Dangote Cement Sustainability Week is a yearly tradition of positively impacting our host communities, through employee volunteering, across our Nigerian and Pan African plants, as well as all Dangote business units.

According to him, only two per cent of flight delays and cancellations may be attributed to operators, while the other 98 per cent are environmentally induced.
While speaking during the presentation of a membership certificate of the International Air Transport Association in Lagos on Thursday, Okonkwo enumerated weather and inadequate infrastructure as some of the factors causing delays and cancellations in the industry.
He said, “The problem of delays is due to weather, and you can’t land at the airport because the Instrument Landing System is not calibrated for the necessary equipment and they are not available. 
“There is nothing you can do. We think that as soon as all the relevant bodies are able to provide the necessary infrastructure and create the right environment, this problem will solve itself.

“Only 2 and 3 percent of delay factors could be attributed to the operators because every aircraft owner knows that you only make money when your aircraft is flying. Aircraft on the ground, whether you fly or not, incur expenses, and when the time comes for the maintenance to be done and the lease to be made, nobody asks you whether you fly or not.

In a statement on Tuesday, the Company said in one of the incidents, an oil bunkering site was uncovered in Osuobodo between two ANTAN flow stations south of Oguta naval base in Imo state.
It stated, “Far from the regular, these criminals have taken their activities a notch higher. In this camp, CCTV cameras have been installed on trees by the thieves to look out for security operatives. Mortar launchers and defence systems were also mounted by the oil thieves in various locations to eliminate any perceived enemy.”
This discovery, NNPCL said, was made possible after an invasion by the military following information gathered by an air surveillance carried out by Target Energy, Tantita security services, Operation Delta Safe and the Military in August. 
It stated that, “It is a well orchestrated mission. The thieves are determined to live here and trade their stolen crude. A lack of electricity is no excuse. Generators are on standby to keep the camp’s operations afloat.”
Drums of crude oil feeding from an illegal connection, bags used for storing crude and more were discovered on the camp, it added.
Again, it said, “Between the 14th to 20th of October, 2023, 49 illegal connections were uncovered in Udu & Ogharefe in Delta State, Ohaji Egbema in Imo, Brass in Bayelsa and in Rivers state.      
“At this spot in Rivers state, oil thieves drilled a tunnel underneath the tarred road to insert their illegal connection. The aim is to operate undetected. This was planned and carried out by an expert, using a horizontal directional drilling machine.”

He gave the warning on the floor of the House of Representatives on Tuesday.
However, the Nigeria Employers Consultative Forum disagreed with the lawmakers on the new CBN policy, saying the importation of the 43 items was not banned in 2015.
It explained that the foreign exchange ban was placed on the items. This, it added,  put pressure on the forex market, adding that the new CBN policy would benefit the nation. 
The House invited the Governor of the CBN, Yemi Cardoso, to appear before it, following the apex bank’s decision to lift the foreign exchange ban on fertilizer, cement, toothpick and 40 other items.
The PUNCH had reported that the 43 items were in 2015 restricted from accessing forex at the official market rate.
CBN’s sudden decision to lift the ban came against the backdrop of high volatility levels experienced in the foreign exchange market owing to the unification of all trading windows into the investors and exporters’ window (the official FX market) by the President Bola Tinubu administration.      
It would be recalled that the apex bank had in a statement issued by its Director of Corporate Communications, Isa AbdulMumin, said, “The CBN reiterates that the prevailing Foreign Exchange (FX) rates should be referenced from platforms such as the CBN website, FMDQ, and other recognised or appointed trading systems to promote price discovery, transparency, and credibility in the FX rates.”
At a plenary session on Tuesday, the Green Chamber passed a resolution to summon the CBN Governor following the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance sponsored by Soli, a member of the House representing Jibia/Kaita Federal Constituency, Katsina State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress.
Justifying the significance of the motion, Soli said the decision of the apex bank may lead to the closure of factories and ultimately erode the nation’s capacity to build the local economy.
In his words, it was doubtful if the new policy would make any meaningful impact on the Nigerian economy. He said ‘middlemen’ may take undue advantage of it for their own good.
Contributing to the motion, a lawmaker representing Oshodi/Isolo II Federal Constituency,  Lagos State, Jesse Onuakalusi, called for the immediate reversal of the policy until the House concluded a legislative action on the matter; a prayer that was rejected by the lawmakers.

An amendment to the motion by Kinglsey Chinda, representing Obio/Akpor Federal Constituency, Rivers State, said that the CBN Governor should appear before the House Committee on Regulatory Banking, Finance and Customs to explain the rationale behind the lifting of the ban was thereafter adopted.
Businesses         
The Chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, said, Mr Niyi Yusuf, said, “Monetary policies cannot be used to tackle trade issues. The competitiveness of our manufacturing industry needs to be improved by using appropriate policies, strategies, tools, and mechanisms. Not every issue can be addressed or solved using monetary policies.”
However the Director-General of the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association, Mr Wale Oyerinde, said, “The lifting of restrictions on the purchase of forex for 43 items was a double edged policy decision.
He said, “It should be noted that the 43 items were never in the prohibition list and thus, were never banned from being imported. Importers of the items only had to source forex from alternative sources, which invariably puts more pressure on the FOREX market.
“While the restrictions helped the gradual investment in local alternatives, it also puts pressure on the forex market, with the potential of widening the gap between the official and parallel market rates. A strategic harmonisation of the fiscal and monetary policies, with inputs from other Ministries could resolve the issues for the benefit of the nation.”
The Director at the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria, Dr. Friday Okpara, said, “The items were not banned in the first place. The only thing was that they were not allowed extra then, through the CBN official window. Now that we have a single forex window the lifting of the ban is insignificant.
“Whether it’s been lifted or not, it doesn’t make any impact. There is no forex anywhere to access.”
Meanwhile, the Chairman, of the Oyo State Chapter of the Agricultural Development Farmers Association, Salihu Imam, said, “Ordinarily if you want to protect the industries you ban import.      
“We must find ways to protect them. We don’t need all these policies whether it is palliative or what have you because it will all lead to corruption. The government must find ways to support the farmers.
“Commercial banks should give out African loans to farmers at the rate of two per cent annually, they will pay. The move to lift the ban on those 43 items is one of those panic measures.”
He added, “You don’t have any measures on the ground, you are removing the subsidy. This is what the government has been doing for ages, always taking panic actions. In some economies of the world, what they do is to ban importation to allow local industries to thrive, then you export and earn forex,” he concluded.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/15185411/Cardozo-e1694800451321.jpg

It disclosed this in its newly released 2024-2026 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper.
It would be recalled that President Bola Tinubu, in July, signed an executive order suspending the implementation of a five per cent excise duty tax on telecoms services.
However, according to the new economic framework for 2024-2026, part of the strategies the government would implement to improve customs revenue collections included the full implementation of excise duty on telecoms. 
The government, in the paper, noted that it would implement these strategies even though some of them were recently suspended.
It said, “The following strategies will be implemented to improve Customs revenue collections over the period 2024-2026, despite the fact that some of them have been recently suspended.
“Full implementation of excise duty on Telecommunication Services in line with the presidential approval published in Official Gazette No. 88 Vol. 109 of 11th May 22 as conveyed vide Finance Act, 2023. This is expected to grow excise revenue significantly and enhance budgetary performance.”        Related News   Shift to solid minerals will boost revenue – Alake  FCTA targets over N250bn monthly generated revenue  FG, states, LGs share N1.1tn August revenue   
Also, the government hinted that it may raise Value Added Tax rates from 7.5 per cent in the medium term. This would probably be to 15 per cent as the International Monetary Fund had over the time advised.
The Federal Government said, “The VAT projections over the medium-term are based on holding the rate at 7.5 per cent. Raising the VAT rate however remains a policy option for government to keep in view over the medium term.”
Raising VAT rate may not be an immediate concern of the government as it said it would intensify efforts at improving VAT coverage and collection efficiency.
It explained, “In the medium term, government will intensify efforts aimed at improving VAT coverage and collection efficiency.
“Wider coverage and improved collection efficiency will be achieved through nationwide VAT registration and monitoring, and deployment of ICT (auto-collect) platforms in more sectors of the economy. In addition, the technology solution for deduction and remittance of VAT and WHT from State Government contract payments is to be deployed in all the 36 states.”
Excise duty on telecom services had been a contentious matter since the government first proposed it, with telcos declaring that they would pass the cost to their subscribers.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/15075012/Tax-illustration.jpg

It said the demand for Nigerian was on the increase, but decried the lack of adequate infrastructure required to transport the commodity out of Nigeria.
The Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Gabriel Aduda, disclosed this at the second edition of the Domestic Gas Summit organised by the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
He said the government lacked the capacity to provide all the required infrastructure and urged the private sector players at the summit to take up the challenge, as they would get the required government support. 
“I want to assure you that the government is ready to do business. People are calling us every day demanding for gas. The energy minister for Turkey has called me more than 10 times, and I’m not exaggerating, that they need natural gas.
“Libyans have been here, and as I speak to you today they’ve forwarded an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) to me that they just want gas in Libya and they want Nigerian gas.
“All these are opportunities, and if I had the money I’ll simply tell everybody to sit down and I’ll build the pipelines and make the money for the rest of my life. We need to be able to identify these opportunities,” Aduda stated.

He said Nigeria has more than 208 trillion cubic feet of gas, stressing that other gas rich nations were taking steps to compete with Nigeria in terms of gas supply.
“The Algerians will not let us rest because they too want to sell gas to the world. The Europeans are not resting either, because they know that if they have access to our gas, it is business for them. So the question is why are we lagging behind in taking this gas out when we have a lot of it here with us.
“Government cannot do it all, I keep emphasizing that. It is the private sector. That is why I believe this summit is of extreme importance and I wish we will be able to come up with the right solutions to handling this,” Aduda stated.
The permanent secretary also told his audience the government was “looking at taking out all the bottlenecks such that we can have a very interesting place where everybody, both the investor and the country will make money and we see power delivered to our people.”
The Director-General, ACCI, Al-mujtaba Abubakar, the summit, with the theme, “Building a Sustainable, Resilient Gas, and Renewable Energy Sector in Nigeria and Beyond,” would promote the discussion of various issues centred on rejuvenating the Nigerian gas industry.
“Its primary objective is to enhance both domestic gas utilisation and the infrastructure needed to make the Nigerian gas industry globally competitive.
“This annual event is with a focus on promoting local content, fostering a friendly business environment through government liaisons, and organising seminars and workshops to ensure that the benefits of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria extend throughout the nation,” he stated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/25025724/nn.png

This strategic move allows Mikano Motors to access a wide array of options, with the Chinese automaker providing access to up to 25 brands, 15 of which are currently on display.
The decision to include Changan in its lineup comes at a pivotal moment for Mikano Motors, as it actively seeks strategic avenues to redefine its longstanding partnership with Geely, another leading Chinese auto firm.
Mikano Motors had exclusively collaborated with Geely in Nigeria for nearly three years before this expansion. 
The Managing Director of Mikano Motors, Ralph Haidar, said in a press conference in Lagos, weekend, that the addition of Changan vehicles to Mikano’s repertoire has raised concerns within Geely, leading to discussions about the complexities of having two distinct Chinese brands operating under a single auto company in Nigeria.
Mikano Motors, while exploring this new venture, remains committed to maintaining strong partnerships and providing Nigerian consumers with diverse options in the rapidly evolving automotive market.

“We have been in the country for the past 30 years. We are very responsible towards our customers. The issue with Geely has been dragging on since July or August 2022 and you know that we have not been importing any of their products but I have been catering to the after-sale of our Geely customers for the past years despite fighting.
Haidar explained that Mikano Motors’ choice to acquire the Changan brand franchise in Nigeria is part of their strategy to expand operations and offer Nigerians access to a diverse range of high-quality vehicles at affordable prices.
He stated, “It is the best brand in the Middle East and other regions and has outstanding service in safety and innovation from its competitors.
“Changan is one of the top Chinese auto brands that is gaining immense popularity worldwide and is known for its value offering across automotive segments.
“It is currently the only brand in Nigeria that can cater to any organization or governmental body and or individual who wishes to buy a brand new, efficient, safe, stylish, and affordable car that has earned the admiration of many customers internationally,” he added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/01042058/Mikano-Motors.png

While headline inflation opened at 26.7 per cent in September, food inflation rose to 30.64 per cent, compared to 29.34 per cent in August 2023. With many more Nigerians sliding into poverty and key economic indicators getting worse, the federal and state governments must do more to arrest mass misery.
Already rising on the back of insecurity, the petrol subsidy stoppage, and the naira’s free fall, food prices are under increased pressure from flooding across the country. The spiraling prices of oil, bread, cereals, potatoes, yam, fish, fruits, meat, vegetables, milk, cheese and eggs have jolted headline inflation. Food inflation on a month-on-month basis was reported to have slumped in August, with Akwa Ibom, Niger, and Ebonyi recording the highest rates.
State governors should join the Federal Government in the fight to stop hunger. They should devise autonomous stimulus programmes instead of perpetually relying on federal “palliatives” and cash doles. They should take the lead in revitalising the agriculture sector and SMEs, while the central government should revise its fiscal reforms, interventions and stimulus activities. It should coordinate more effectively with the Central Bank of Nigeria to ensure a conflation of fiscal with monetary policies that will radically improve the macroeconomic operating environment.
Comparatively, annual food inflation in South Africa slid from 9.9 per cent in July to 8.0 per cent in August per Statistics South Africa. In Brazil, food inflation was officially 0.47 per cent in August, while annual food inflation in Russia in June was 3.25 per cent. In India, wholesale food inflation decreased from 5.62 per cent in August to 1.54 per cent in September 2023. Like Nigeria, Egypt and Ghana are contending with higher food inflation. 
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation said Nigeria has 34 million undernourished people, and 15.9 per cent prevalence of undernourishment; 45 million people are food insecure, while prevalence of food insecurity was 21.5 per cent in 2021.
While hunger is pervasive, farmers are also plagued on all sides. Flooding, desertification and other harsh weather conditions sabotage their enterprise. Violent Fulani herders ravage their farms, while terrorists and bandits oppress them. Public agriculture programmes such as the Anchor Borrowers’ Fund are politicised and mismanaged. Most farming is done by smallholders instead of mechanised production. Lack of adequate support from state governments leaves the farmers marooned.  Related News   JUST IN: Pastor Bakare not competent to criticise Tinubu's reforms – APC scribe  Call for airport concession, reforms grows as aviation growth slows  Cost of food pushes UK inflation to 10%   
President Bola Tinubu’s policies, often imposed without planning, trigger inflation and hardship. He should change tactics, apply rigorous analysis and strategy, and target stimulus packages that will assist farmers, SMEs, mining, transportation, manufacturing and job creation. There should be emergency programmes on raising power output, local petroleum refining, and agriculture. Insecurity needs to be tamed to allow unfettered production and haulage.      
State governors should partner with the private sector, NGOs, and aid agencies to initiate practical micro credit schemes for farmers and encourage young entrepreneurs to venture into agriculture.
Tinubu’s declaration of a state of emergency on food security, and a revamp of the controversial conditional cash transfer programme it inherited hardly reverse poverty. More sustainable policies are required. Saudi Arabia and Egypt each revamped and revitalised their agriculture sectors within a few years.
In the First Republic, it was the regional governments that drove successful agricultural programmes, and put Nigeria on the world map for groundnuts, cocoa, and palm oil production. Today’s 36 states should toe that path.
Tinubu and his economic team must secure the country and implement effective economic policies.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01115850/Food-market.jpg

Umahi, after a recent road inspection tour across the country, lamented that no existing federal road could survive for seven years as the contractors had done terrible jobs. He said many roads were riddled with “potholes” that had deteriorated into “boreholes.” The challenge falls on him, President Bola Tinubu, the state governors, and local government bosses to remedy the situation.
Umahi declared,“There is no project being constructed right now in Nigeria that is going to last for seven years. The question is, are we going to be maintaining or reconstructing our roads every 10 years? That is what we have been doing. I travelled from Abuja to Benin City through Lokoja, all the stretches of the road are on contract, and ongoing, but how much of the roads are motorable? I travelled through the roads myself and I shed tears for the kind of pains our people are going through.”
Nigeria’s road infrastructure shortfall is indeed critical. With a land mass of 923,768 square kilometres and a population of 216 million, it boasts just about 200,000km road network. About 63 per cent of this is un-tarred and most are in disrepair. Visitors describe the roads variously as “death traps,” “deplorable,” or “dilapidated.”
Estimates of funds needed to fix the deficit vary. While the African Development Bank prescribes $150 billion annually over three decades, Dataphyte says $2.3 trillion is required, and the World Bank $3 trillion. 
Roads are the arteries through which an economy breathes. Federal and state authorities must therefore act decisively. Efforts should be made to attract private capital and management expertise. Malaysia, India, and South Africa are among countries that have adopted this model with resounding success.
Federal roads comprise 36,000km of the total network, while 31,000km are state roads. The rest are LG roads. With over 135,000km of roads un-tarred, this glaring infrastructure inadequacy has stymied economic development, and helped entrench joblessness and poverty.

The Federal Government has launched various initiatives and interventions. These include the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, and the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund to fund.      
The tax credit scheme is facilitating the reconstruction of the 35km Apapa-Oshodi Expressway in Lagos by Dangote Industries at the cost of N73 billion. The Sukuk funding for road construction, which recorded 132.25 per cent over-subscription in 2019, is an ingenious response; the second tranche of the N100 billion will finance 28 road projects nationwide.
However, these initiatives have been inadequate in bridging the gap. Efforts should be made to attract foreign investment in road projects. Quality should also be emphasised.
In 2019, Namibia had the highest road quality infrastructure in Africa, according to business executives’ perceptions. Egypt and Rwanda followed respectively. Nigeria must therefore bolster investments in roads.
The states and LGs should expand and upgrade their road networks. The Federal Government, in collaboration with the states, should commence a massive multi-year federal highways master plan to link all state capitals, major cities and industrial clusters through expansive expressways, jointly funded by the states, private capital and aid.
There should be similar programmes at the sub-national level with master plans of highways linking all LG HQs, major towns, and agriculture, mining, and commercial centres in each state.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/26014600/Lagos-Abeokuta.jpg

Tho...,"<span class=""post-date"">24th October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/tinubu-its-time-to-crush-insurgency/,  Punch Editorial Board,"THE recent revelation by Beacon Consulting that 252 persons were killed in Borno State in August underscores the urgency of adopting improved strategies to finally defeat the terrorist insurgency. Though Beacon acknowledged successful interdiction efforts by security operatives, other reports nevertheless noted renewed attacks in parts of the state that featured supposedly “repentant terrorists” who had returned to the terror fold. President Bola Tinubu should pay close attention, and task the security chiefs to launch a final assault to crush the terrorists.
Notably, the consultancy stated that significant progress had been made recently in countering the terrorists through enhanced coordination, collaboration, and cooperation among security operatives. It also noted that most of the deaths were actually of terrorists killed in clashes with security forces, or among rival terrorist factions. The military’s momentum should therefore be ramped up.
Too many lives have been lost since Boko Haram launched its insurgency in 2009. More persons are still being killed, others kidnapped, girls and women enslaved, and social and economic activities disrupted in many parts of the North. The terror groups remain active despite the military’s onslaught.
The Global Centre for Responsibility to Protect reported that 35,000 persons have been killed since 2009. In 2017, the Borno State Government stated that 100,000 persons had so far been killed, 2.1 million others displaced, and creating 52,311 orphans, and 54,911 widows. 
The Nigeria Security Tracker reported that at least 27 persons were killed by terrorists in Chibok in October. Israeli-based Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center stated that in September, two fishermen died in the crossfire during a clash between ISWAP and Boko Haram over taxation rights in the Lake Chad area.
Also in September, jihadists killed 10 farmers and abducted four others in Mafa LGA for failing to pay tributes to the terrorists. The insurgents sneaked into Zannari ward in Maiduguri, the state capital, and extorted N4 million from a businessman.
Unfortunately, the military sticks to the illusion that it can rehabilitate and reintroduce ‘repentant terrorists’ into communities. It should drop this dangerous policy. It follows from a wrong understanding of the Salafist ideology that drives Islamic terrorism, and from the politicisation of insecurity.        Related News   Tinubu seeks Senate's confirmation of ICPC chairman, others  JUST IN: Tinubu approves N18bn assurance policy for fallen heroes' families  Tinubu, prosecute Bawa or release him   
Nigeria should learn from Iraq and Afghanistan, where jihadists pretend to “repent,” only to stage horrific killings from within the security forces.
A 2020 report by Nextier SDP showed that communities that have borne the brunt of insurgents, including loss of properties, dignity, and livelihood, and loved ones, oppose such faulty reintegration.
Also, there are no parameters to delineate hard-line Salafist murderers from those forced to join the terrorists’ ranks; therefore, the programme may serve as an adaptable tool for terrorists to gain access to communities, provide strategic information to terrorists and sabotage the counter-insurgency campaign.
In March, troops apprehended Baána Bdiya, a “repentant” and “rehabilitated” Boko Haram fighter who, thereafter, helped terrorists ambush and kill soldiers in the Lake Chad Basin area.
Insurgency has devastated the North-East and North-West;48 per cent of the 7.6 million out of schoolgirls in Nigeria are from the two regions, while 1.6 million children of both genders are not schooling in the North-East, says UNICEF. Poverty prevails, as 86.1 per cent of 133 million multi-dimensionally poor Nigerians live in the North. Insurgency has sabotaged governance and food security nationally.
The Nigeria Police and the military must salvage the glaring intelligence-gathering deficit. They should upgrade their skills and increasingly deploy ICT tools, especially drones, to combat terrorism. They should also upgrade local buy-in mechanisms such as the Joint Military/Civilian Task Force and local vigilantism.
Tinubu should prioritise security and motivate the security agencies to quickly destroy the insurgency.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/11101001/Bola-Tinubu2.jpg

The naira plunged even further against other currencies, petrol and gas prices rose, as well as inflation, while a new report captures rising level of hunger. Tinubu and the Central Bank of Nigeria must work harder to avoid losing control.
The signs are alarming. At the foreign exchange market, the naira took further battering, selling at N999 at the official window, and almost N1,200 at the parallel market. Across the country, many petrol filling stations stopped dispensing; those selling adjusted their prices upwards. Diesel, kerosene, and cooking gas prices keep shooting upwards. Shortfalls continued in electricity power supply.
Manufacturers and SMEs voiced fresh alarm of more closures, and job losses. The National Bureau of Statistics released figures showing food inflation rising to 30.64 per cent, amid a general inflation rate of 26.72 per cent, up from 25.8 per cent.
The latest UN Global Hunger Index is gloomy. It said, “Nigeria ranks 109th out of the 125 countries. With a score of 28.3, Nigeria has a level of hunger that is serious.” 
The government’s responses seem to worsen rather than improve the situation. The administration and the domestic and international agencies backing its shock policies that have triggered the worsening economic indicators however insist that these are necessary to lift the economy sustainability.
But Tinubu and the CBN Governor, Wale Edun, need to exercise extensive rigour before introducing policies. They should learn from their serial mistakes. The sudden stoppage of petrol subsidies and flotation of the naira triggered unprecedented inflation, and the naira’s headlong plunge. The advertised advantages, such as flooding of the market by independent petrol marketers, realistic pricing, and a boost in dollar supply among others, have not materialised. Marketers have backed out, leaving the petrol import burden solely to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited.  Related News   IPPIS: FG to stop salaries of unverified workers Friday  Igboho knocks Gumi for faulting Tinubu's appointments    FG okays $3.45bn W’Bank loan application for power, others   
With no improvement in public finances, the government continues to borrow to contain the fallout of its policies. When it bowed again to pressure and lifted the eight-year-old restriction on direct forex sale for the importation of 43 items, typically, the CBN did not edit the list to remove stuff like toothpicks. The naira nosedived further within days; instead of the promised improvement in supply, more dollar scarcity ensued.      
Even the cheerleaders are worried. The World Bank deplores rising debts, including a $1.5 billion, and a separate $400 million in addition to previously negotiated ones, all to provide “palliatives,” wage increases, and recurrent spending. The IMF offered a dollar loan to “support the naira,” appearing to forget its long-running campaign against the CBN’s interventions to prop up the national currency.
Fitch, a global rating agency, said Nigeria suffers external vulnerabilities, due to “a recent loss of reform momentum and the constrained reserve position that highlight the significant challenges.” The IMF’s ‘World Outlook’ report projected South Africa to temporarily overtake Nigeria as Africa’s largest economy.
Amid the turmoil, the government has committed itself to higher public sector salaries; has refused to cut costs and approved new state-run higher education institutions. Industrial scale oil theft continues, and agencies like the NNPC and others serially indicted for waste, corruption and withholding of funds are carrying on business as usual. The states remain parasitic cost centres instead of productive units.
Tinubu and his team need to think outside the box; in adopting free market policies, extensive diagnosis must be undertaken, and scenarios envisaged and prepared for. In today’s knowledge-driven and rapidly evolving realities, liberalising policies must be adapted and adaptable to existing conditions, well-timed and comprehensive.
Current scatter-shot measures are tipping the economy into a red zone; Tinubu and Edun should reach for more pragmatic solutions to avoid a collapse.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/28173125/Wale-Edun.png

Ola ...,"<span class=""post-date"">23rd October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/an-uncertain-future-for-efcc-icpc/,  Punch Editorial Board,"THE controversy around the emergence of the sixth Executive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission reflects the country’s failing anti-corruption war and its uncertain future. Ola Olukoyede was approved as new EFCC head after another shambolic Senate screening and amid protests by groups questioning his qualification for the job, and the continued detention of his predecessor, Abdulrasheed Bawa. Olukoyede and Musa Aliyu, who has been nominated to head the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, will need uncommon courage to rid Nigeria of graft.
Set up as the arrowhead of the fight to crush corruption, EFCC, since its take-off in 2003, has had a rough existence. Controversy is its handmaiden. Olukoyede’s arrival typifies this. Some insist that he does not meet the criteria set out in the enabling law for appointment as the CEO, his experience in law enforcement being limited to the few years he served as chief of staff in the agency.
Critics say that the 15 years of cognate experience in the police or other security occupation stipulated by the EFCC Act therefore precludes him from the position. His supporters dismiss this. The Senate, compliant as ever, did not allow robust debate and a satisfactory resolution, but swiftly rubber-stamped President Bola Tinubu’s choice. Opponents have headed for the court.
He has entered a minefield. His five predecessors were each hounded out of office; four were accused of corrupt practices. The pioneer chairman, Nuhu Ribadu, has turned full circle. Having plunged headlong into partisan politics after his ouster, he is currently Tinubu’s National Security Adviser, comfortable in the company of the same persons he once accused and investigated for corruption. 
His successors – Farida Waziri, Ibrahim Lamorde, Ibrahim Magu (who was never confirmed), and Bawa – were similarly humiliated out of office, and accused of graft.
Bawa, the first insider, having been recruited and spent his entire career in the agency, unlike the first four who were veteran police officers, is having a worse deal. Tinubu and the Directorate of State Services are violating his freedom with impunity. He has been detained for almost four months without trial, and his resignation communicated from captivity.  Related News   Tinubu seeks Senate's confirmation of ICPC chairman, others  PICTORIAL: EFCC operatives allegedly held hostage by staff, students of Oyo college  Court jails man for land fraud in Maiduguri   
Can Olukoyede deliver? Many Nigerians are pessimistic. Subverted from inception, and continuously by successive presidents and their attorneys-general, the EFCC has been more effective in harassing fraudsters than stopping brazen treasury looting.      
The country suffers. At the federal, state, and local governments, looting is the main preoccupation. The US Commerce Department says that 40 per cent of public procurement sums is routinely stolen. Chatham House, a British non-profit, estimates that about $582 billion of public funds were pilfered 1960 to 2019. Another estimate puts the amount stolen 1999 to 2019 at N11 trillion. A joint NEITI/Trust Africa report reckons that over 62 per cent of the funds required to finance Nigeria’s annual budget is stolen.
Both agencies have however fought bravely on despite the subversion of the political overlords and the shortcomings of their own heads, and kept the anti-corruption flame alive, though barely. The EFCC secured 3,785 convictions in 2022, recovered N152 billion and $386 million in 2021. The ICPC also recovered N454 billion stolen funds in the four years to June 2022, and secured 90 convictions.
But while internet fraudsters, scammers, and lower-level officials are nabbed, the PEPs are walking free, having nearly emasculated the agencies.
Olukoyede and Aliyu’s assignment are daunting. At least 25 current high office holders, including Tinubu, Senate President Godswill Akpabio, many other senators and ministers, and ex-governors of the ruling party have been variously accused of corruption.
Both men will therefore need to muster exceptional courage to execute their mandate. Nigerians should support them.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/04121722/efcc.jpg

The challenges facing the nation’s healthcare system are complex...","<span class=""post-date"">23rd October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/revolutionising-healthcare-financing/,Fejiro Chinye-Nwoko,"Access to quality healthcare is a fundamental human right, but millions of Nigerians still lack access to proper healthcare services. The challenges facing the nation’s healthcare system are complex and deep-seated, ranging from inadequate infrastructure to limited resources. The existing healthcare financing mechanisms are insufficient to meet the needs of a population exceeding 200 million people.
Health financing, the beating heart of a robust healthcare system, holds the key to achieving universal health coverage. Yet, as we peer into the tapestry of our nation’s health ecosystem, we find gaps and disparities that hinder millions from accessing care due to the weight of financial burdens. It’s time to rewrite this narrative and pave the path towards a healthier Nigeria.
Before exploring Public-Private Partnerships in Nigeria, we must grasp the context of its healthcare system. Nigeria, known as the “Giant of Africa,” due to its vast population and diverse culture, holds promise in various sectors. However, its healthcare system consistently falls short, necessitating innovative solutions like PPPs. According to the World Bank, Nigeria allocates approximately 3.7 per cent of its GDP to healthcare, which, while seemingly significant, pales in comparison to countries with similar GDP. Additionally, Nigeria’s health system ranks 187th out of 191 World Health Organisation member states, indicating  substantial disparities.
Numerous critical issues afflicting Nigeria’s healthcare system include insufficient facilities. Many healthcare centres, particularly in rural areas, lack modernisation and equipment, limiting access to primary care. The populace faces inadequate healthcare infrastructure. A significant dearth of trained healthcare professionals, such as doctors and nurses, plagues Nigeria. 
The ratio of doctors to citizens is notably low, with many healthcare professionals seeking opportunities abroad. Nigeria grapples with an erratic supply chain for essential medical resources, which is aggravated by counterfeit medications that endanger public health. These factors underscore the urgent need for a transformative approach, with PPPs emerging as a potential solution. Collaboration between the public and private sectors could offer a sustainable, scalable model to address myriad healthcare challenges.
PPPs have emerged as a dynamic and strategic tool to address the issues of healthcare financing. PPP is an agreement between the government and the private sector, primarily aimed at delivering public infrastructure, community amenities, and associated services. These enduring collaborations involve a joint commitment to investing, sharing risks and rewards, and assuming responsibilities; all with the goal of benefiting both participating parties.  Related News   
Several countries have successfully implemented PPPs in healthcare, serving as valuable models for Nigeria. Examples include India’s PPP-driven National Rural Health Mission and Malaysia’s collaboration with private entities to establish world-class medical tourism facilities. The Brampton Civic Hospital in Ontario, Canada, is used to illustrate the application of PPPs in healthcare infrastructure development. PPP, therefore, offers a win-win solution for the Nigerian government, private sector entities, and, most importantly, the citizens in need of healthcare services.      
PPPs can elevate Nigeria’s healthcare system through healthcare financing by diverse revenue streams and strategic investment. Diversification mitigates risks and enhances financial sustainability; thereby  embracing a multi-faceted approach to revenue generation, such as exploring government budgets, compulsory or voluntary prepaid insurance schemes, and external aid as potential sources of funding. Channeling these funds into strategic health system blocks can help to improve infrastructure and healthcare accessibility.
Consolidating prepaid funds through PPPs helps to ensure healthcare is accessible not only to the privileged members of society. Pooling fosters solidarity, making quality care accessible to all while leveraging private sector efficiency. By strategically purchasing in PPPs, this involves allocating resources thoughtfully to healthcare providers through PPPs. Payment arrangements within PPPs should incentivise care coordination and elevate service quality through timely disbursement of funds, ensuring an adequate supply of staff and medicine, guaranteeing optimal patient care.
Transparency in PPPs and service coverage ensures that healthcare services are accessible and reduces hidden out-of-pocket expenses, while also ensuring that private sector partners meet high standards of service quality. Laying down clear policies regarding which services citizens are entitled to receive through PPPs helps to promote accessibility to healthcare.
The WHO offers a guiding light in this journey by emphasising the importance of strengthening health system resilience, ensuring health security, and achieving UHC. It’s about securing the necessary resources, risk-sharing, and wisely investing these funds to improve   the health of every Nigerian. The nation’s healthcare story is still being written, and you have a pivotal role to play. Let’s unite, innovate, and fund the future of healthcare in Nigeria, ensure a healthier, more equitable tomorrow through the power of PPPs.

According to the Minister of Steel Development, Shuaibu Audu, the government is embarking on a three-year plan to resuscitate the moribund complex as part of the President’s agenda to diversify the economy, create jobs and attract foreign direct investment. While these are desirable targets and steel is a vital industrial impetus, spending any additional money on the complex is a wrong move; the pragmatic way forward is toprivatise it quickly and transparently.
“Revitalising,” “completing,” and concessionsundertaken over the past three decades have failed disastrously, kept the multibillion-dollar complex idle, and excluded Nigeria from the club of industrialising economies. Tinubu should avoid the mistakes and chicanery of his predecessors, and spare the treasury any further waste, and Nigerians further agony.
Steel, declared the World Steel Association, “is the world’s most important engineering and construction material.” The American Iron and Steel Institute says it is an “essential material in everyday existence, underpinning transportation, shelter, water and food supply, national security and the generation of energy.” A vibrant steel industry is a sure marker of a successful economy.
Nigeria’s ambition to industrialise with a domestic steel industry as its backbone has suffered multiple shipwrecks since the government launched its ambitious steel programme four decades ago. 
Statements today by the government that ASC “is nearing completion and would employ 500,000 Nigerians once designated as a free trade zone” cause apprehension because of the scandalous history of the steel projects. Indeed, they are alarming, as they suggest that the government is once more pursuing the costly and failed track of throwing more money into a venture it cannot profitably run, instead of outright asset sale to attract capable investors and foreign investments. Let private capital get the job done.
Any attempt by the government to continue with the “rehabilitation” of the moribund steel plant misplaced. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria estimates that the country has spent over $8 billion on the idle steel complexwithout kick-starting production.
ASC was incorporated in the Fourth National Development Plan and concretised by the administration of former President Shehu Shagari (1979-1983) to be the bedrock of Nigeria’s industrialisation. An integrated steel plant, it was built on 24,000 hectares of land; it is the largest steel complex in sub-Saharan Africa by some estimates, and the coke oven and by-products plant are larger than all the state-owned refineries in the country combined.      
But serially mismanaged, it remains incomplete 44 years later. Three-quarters of the complex has reportedly been abandoned, and only the light mills have been put into operation for small-scale fabrication and the production of iron rods.
An iron mining company at Itakpe, Kogi State; steel rolling mills in Jos,Plateau State, Katsina, and Osogbo, Osun State, and the Delta Steel Company in Ovwian-Aladja, Delta State, constitute the other wings of the national steel production complex.
But years of mismanagement led to massive degradation. By the late 1980s, it was no longer expedient for government to own and run businesses, which made privatising ASC and others the only sustainable option to keep the steel dream alive.  Related News   Igboho knocks Gumi for faulting Tinubu's appointments    Student loan scheme begins January, says Tinubu  BREAKING: INEC, Tinubu disagree as Atiku urges S'Court to admit fresh evidence   
Several attempts to concession the ASC have ended in corruption scandals, asset stripping and litigation. Nigeria is a serial loser. In the last botched concession deal, the government ceded Itakpe and also paid $496 million as compensation to the concessionaire. Ajaokuta had not produced a single sheet of steel by December 2017. The light mills were finally put into operation in 2018 for small-scale fabrication and the production of iron rods. However, three-quarters of the plant has been abandoned, including heavy equipment and the internal railway.
At one point, the Federal Government invited the Russian government to rehabilitate and manage it. The Russiansthen nominated the original builder of the complex to conduct a technical audit. That deal also collapsed.
Injecting scarce funds into the steel complex on a continuous basis without commensurate production has created a cesspool of corruption, with thebillions appropriated annually wasted, and workers being paid for doing nothing. Nigeria has similarly kept on spending billions on four moribund petroleum refineries.
In 2004, a visiting World Bank team determined that the project was not viable. There should therefore be no more delay in selling the complexto any of the world’s major operators as core investor. Concession and so-called rehabilitation are a waste of time and resources.        
McKinsey, a global consultancy, notes that the global steel industry’s outlook for the next decade is shaky. Nigeria should quickly unload its steel assets to competent players in the international market. Total world crude steel production was just less than 2.0 billion metric tons in 2021, a four percent increase over 2020 figures, reported Statista. Demand is forecast to rise this year after years of low demand.
The Tinubu government should therefore drop the concession option; just sell the complex to investors with the expertise and resources to turn it around and translate Nigeria’s steel and industrialisation dream into reality. This way, the government will recover some of the money it had invested over the years, and deploy the savings to critical infrastructure like roads and railways. Concessions have failed and imply a continuation of the calamitous template of state ownership.
Government should instead concentrate on regulation and creating and sustaining an enabling environment for private investment and entrepreneurship.
The National Bureau of Statistics said Nigeria imported iron, steel and other metals valued at N837.76 billion in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Basic metal products imported within the period were worth N748.52 billion, and iron and steel, N88.23 billion.
Experts insist that since steelremains a necessary stimulus to national development and industrialisation, Nigeria should doggedly pursue that dream.Three BRICScountries – China, India, and Russia – are among the world’s five top steel producers; a fourth, Brazil is ninth largest producer, while South Africa is second largest in Africa after Egypt.
Hanging on to Ajaokuta in whatever guise is unwise; Tinubu should just privatise it transparentlyto reputable international steel sector multinationals.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/11183908/Tinubu-signs.jpeg

Lately, there has been a spike in the kidnapping segment resulting in renewed security shocks. Reports emerge daily around the country of assailants attacking and kidnapping citizens either for ransom, or ritual purposes. In the north, terrorists and bandits are kidnapping girls and young women as sex slaves, “brides” and camp attendants. This is another major challenge for President Bola Tinubu and his security chiefs.
Amid economic adversity, widespread poverty and anxiety, criminals are tormenting Nigerians and overwhelming the security apparatus. Many girls and young women are currently being held by bandits in Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna states.
In September, gunmen kidnapped 11 people travelling from Onitsha, Anambra State, to Makurdi, the Benue State capital, on the Ugbokolo/Otukpa federal highway. It was the second time in one week that gunmen would intercept Benue Links buses and kidnap passengers. On September 10, no fewer than 10 passengers in two buses were also kidnapped on the Ajaokuta/Okene Road.
The Christ Apostolic Church Nigeria last week advised its members to stop travelling in branded buses. This followed the interception and kidnap of 25 of its choristers by gunmen on September 29 at Ifon, Ose Local Government Area, Ondo State. 
While the police rescued eight of those abducted within hours, the remaining victims regained their freedom only on October 6, after their families paid a combined ransom of N50million ransom.
Gunmen also kidnapped a retired army general, R.C Duru, in Owerri, Imo State, and took him and his Mercedes Benz SUV away. The vehicle was later found abandoned in Mbaitoli.
Kidnappers should not be allowed to overrun Nigeria. The country is already afflicted with terrorism, banditry, Fulani herdsmen violence, gang violence and armed robbery. Tinubu and the Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, as well as the military and other security agencies must do much more to protect Nigerians.        Related News   FCT police arrest suspected robbers, carjacker, kidnappers' informant  Bandits kill Imam in Kaduna mosque attack  Bandits kill two in Kaduna fuel station attack   
Nowhere is safe; people are snatched on their farms, homes, work places, on the major and secondary roads, and in schools and hostels. Kidnappers operate in and around the Federal Capital Territory, sometimes right within the city precincts and its gated residential estates.
The hoodlums now target girls. Moving in a convoy of about 50 motorcycles, bandits last month raided a female hostel of the Federal University, Gusau, Zamfara State, and took away 30 students. Another gang this month abducted five female students from their hostel at the Federal University, Dutsin-ma, Katsina State.
SBM Intelligence reported that between July 2022 and June 2023, 3,620 people were abducted in over 582 kidnapping incidents across the country, with reported combined ransom demand of N5 billion, and an actual ransom payment of over N302 million.  This figure is reckoned to be understated due to under-reporting.
Security chiefs that fail serially should be promptly dropped and replaced. The Department of State Services, Nigeria’s domestic intelligence agency, has been inefficient in its primary duty, and distracts itself in matters better left to the police and anti-corruption agencies. Tinubu should reform the agency and refocus it for efficiency.
Nigeria’s current security challenges require devolution of law enforcement. All policing is local; the federal police force cannot be everywhere. The urgency of state policing is now critical.
States can no longer afford to wait for protection from an over-stretched federal police agency. While pressing for a constitution amendment, they should establish their own security outfits, fund, equip, train and arm them adequately.  The existing regional security agencies should be strengthened and well-funded.
Egbetokun should map out an effective response. Kidnapping must be stamped out. Tinubu should task the security agencies accordingly.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/11161613/Bandits.jpeg

While lawmakers lamented the continued loss of crude, and urged the security agencies to expose collaborators in their midst, lobbyists are reportedly seeking to have the House jettison the report. Legislators should stand firm, see the task through to its logical conclusion and hurry forward with its mission to expose complicit officials.
A Reps committee is probing the massive oil theft in the Niger Delta following the stunning discovery of extensive collaboration by regulatory agencies and security agencies. It will also beam its searchlight on the activities of marginal field operators, who allegedly aid crude oil theft to complement shortfalls in their production.
It has held interactions with security agencies and will also engage operators of the marginal fields, as well as 14 production-sharing contract operators, and 57 joint venture operators.
Hopefully, this probe should shed light on Nigeria’s opaque oil industry. But the prevailing culture of ‘state capture’ has intruded. Reports indicate that some persons and entities being investigated are mounting intense pressure on the Speaker of the House, Tajudeen Abass, to stop the committee from proceeding with the task. Abass and the committee should rebuff such lobbyists. 
Oil theft is harming Nigeria. It is losing about 40 per cent of explored crude oil to theft and inaccuracies in measurement due to poor maintenance of metering facilities. The House estimated that $4 billion was lost in 2021 at the rate of 200,000 barrels per day. Recently, the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, confirmed that 400,000 barrels were stolen each day. Consequently, the country cannot meet its current OPEC production quota of 1.8 million bpd.
The rub is that security personnel have been found to be complicit and facilitating massive oil theft in the Niger Delta. Credible allegations indicate that senior military personnel are neck-deep in the industrial scale theft.  Related News   NNPCL records 149 oil theft cases in one week  Off-cycle election: INEC postpones meeting with NSA  Senate condemns N2.3tn oil theft, probes security agents   
NEITI revealed that about 619.7 million barrels of crude oil, valued at $46.16 billion had been stolen in the 12 years to 2022. Allegations by a former Niger Delta militant in June reiterating the pervasive involvement of military personnel in oil theft reconfirms the need for a thorough investigation. Described as an organised crime perpetrated by the elite, oil theft reportedly draws in powerful cabals in the highest levels of government, the security agencies and the oil industry.      
Apart from the Reps probe, President Bola Tinubu should order investigations by the NSA and the anti-graft agencies. The military should initiate its own in-house investigation. It should uncover collaborators within its ranks, serving and retired.
In 2022, the then Chief of Defence Staff, Lucky Irabor, vowed to investigate oil theft activities after visiting oil theft sites in Delta State alongside oil sector executives. His successor, Chris Musa, should follow through on this promise. The Nigerian Navy especially must cleanse its ranks of complicit officers.
Most confounding in Nigeria’s oil theft saga is the setting on fire of vessels along with intercepted stolen crude inland or out in the sea. Without thorough investigation, prosecution or court order! This government should stop that bizarre and wasteful practice.
The impact of oil theft on the economy is enormous as crude oil accounts for about 90 per cent of the country’s revenue. According to a paper published in the European Modern Studies Journal, Nigeria lost revenue of $2.1 billion, $1.9 billion, $7.2 billion, and $22.4 billion for 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
The government must make stronger and more effective efforts to protect pipelines and other economic assets. Security operatives involved in oil theft should be unmasked, apprehended and prosecuted. Collaborators within its ranks must be brought to justice.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10173308/Oil-theft.jpg

Confirming ...,"<span class=""post-date"">19th October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/stimulate-economy-through-smes/,  Punch Editorial Board,"THE suspension of the N-Power programme by the Federal Government reiterates the need to dump past failed strategies and opt for programmes to stimulate economic growth and tackle poverty. Confirming the flaws in the controversial scheme, the government disclosed that it uncovered ‘ghost beneficiaries,’ and irregularities in the payments from consultants. Short-term cash payments and inefficiently distributed “palliatives” provide only mild succour; to reverse poverty sustainably requires effective stimulus programmes and support for SMEs. President Bola Tinubu should adopt that strategy.
Already, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Betta Edu, in line with Tinubu’s agenda, has promised to rejuvenate the N-Power project, a poverty-alleviation scheme. In a campaign to validate the National Social Register, the administration has begun its ‘Renewed Hope’ Conditional Cash Transfer scheme under which N1 trillion would be distributed among 61 million poor Nigerians.
Sceptics worry about its prospects of success. Edu said 15 million households across the country would each receive N25,000 monthly for three months to provide relief from the severe hardship provoked by the petrol subsidy stoppage.
When he flagged off the programme in Abuja on Tuesday, Tinubu said it would help uplift poor and vulnerable Nigerians. However, similar schemes in the past failed to make appreciable impact. Instead, they became enmeshed in scandals while poverty increased. Politicians often hijacked the funds and the items meant for distribution. Hundreds of billions of naira vanished and were never accounted for. Nepotism, sectionalism, and fraud allegations were rife. 
The suspension of N-Power means over one million job losses with a nine-month payment backlog. The N1.3 trillion spent on the National Social Investment Programme between 2016 and 2023 failed to reduce poverty. The ministry stated that N890.7 billion was spent on the N-Power component, N246 billion on CCT, N17.6 billion on Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme, N2.7 million on independent monitors, and N200.9 billion on the school feeding programme.
There is no reliable, accessible register. Edu also lamented recently that young employees under the scheme had abandoned their duty posts, while consultants sabotaged the system.
Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Statistics said in 2022 that 40 per cent of Nigerians are classified as poor, and 63 per cent ‘multi-dimensionally poor,’ with a 53.4 per cent youth unemployment rate.      
The scheme should be thoroughly probed, corrupt consultants and beneficiaries exposed, and their ill-gotten wealth recovered.

Tinubu should concentrate on stimulus programmes, primarily for MSMEs, agriculture, small-scale mining, and youth entrepreneurship. He needs to restructure the macroeconomic environment to make it safe for investment, production and commerce.
An emergency programme is needed to raise power output, transmission and distribution. He should encourage the states to launch their power projects with the private sector taking the lead.
Another emergency programme is required to drive self-sufficiency in domestic petroleum refining, including privatising the four state-owned moribund refineries.
While a short-term cash transfer activity is a response to prevailing hardship, it should give way to more impactful fiscal and monetary policies. Privatisation will earn revenue and free funds for investment in critical infrastructure and social services. Honestly undertaken, it will attract foreign investment, stimulate jobs, and generate tax income at a sustainable rate.
The states should promote micro-credit schemes, working through cooperatives, trade groups, market women, and skilled artisans as targets.
In July, the National Economic Council rightly rejected the discredited NCR and argued that the sub-national governments should drive the planning and implementation of poverty alleviation programmes with a state-drawn register.        
The states should also prioritise investment in basic rural infrastructure, transportation, health, and education. They should each map out short, medium and long-term economic plans with production, investment, job creation and GDP growth targets.
Palliatives have limited value; effectively applied stimulus must follow to revive the economy and defeat poverty.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/16175056/IMG-20210516-WA0002.jpg

Whi...","<span class=""post-date"">19th October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/nigerias-public-service-needs-sweeping-reforms/,  Punch Editorial Board,"THE recent altercation between the Minister of Works, David Umahi, and ministry workers should remind President Bola Tinubu of the imperative of undertaking sweeping reforms in the public service. While the minister had locked out workers for lateness, protests compelled him to seek accommodation with the irate civil servants. Beyond that drama, the public service is in crisis; Tinubu should overhaul the broken system.
Umahi had arrived early at the ministry’s headquarters in Abuja to find that only a few workers had turned up well after the official resumption time. He ordered the gates shut and latecomers were forced to loiter outside.
But this attracted aggressive protests. The workers insisted that transportation costs had risen astronomically, and buses and taxis were hard to find. Both sides called a truce.
But the issues of Nigeria’s public service and its relevance in its present form remain. Structured into Ministries, Departments and Agencies, the civil service of any country is the administrative arm of the government “responsible for formulating and implementing government policies, programmes and projects.” 
For these activities to be well executed argues a UK-based think tank, Institute for Government, “they need to be done by people with the appropriate training and expertise, and for government to operate effectively, it therefore needs a workforce with a range of different skill sets.”
To the dismay of experts and most Nigerians, the country’s federal, state, and local public services hardly exhibit these skills.
Though the rot began decades ago, today, the federal civil service is huge: over 1.5 million staffers are on the payroll. According to critics, it is bursting with excess staff, incompetent, corrupt, and mostly idle. It is politicised, merit has been compromised, nepotism and mediocrity prevail, and rules are broken with impunity.      
Past attempts at reforms have failed to deliver a civil service that can drive national development. Tinubu has acknowledged that the system is oversized.  Related News   Concrete roads: Stop plotting against FG's plan, Umahi tells foreign contractors  Concrete roads: Umahi threatens to drag saboteurs to ICPC  Stop Akpabio, others from collecting salaries, pensions, SERAP tells court   
Previous reform programmes include the National Strategy for Public Service Reforms, Bureau of Public Service Reforms, and the introduction of e-government initiative. All have faltered.
The cherished values of the civil service – impartiality, objectivity, integrity, and honesty– have collapsed. Efficient bureaucracies drove development initiated by Nigeria’s First Republic regional governments.
In the 1980s, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced sweeping reforms that included decoupling some services from the public service into the hands of the more efficient private sector.
A 2019 survey showed New Zealanders have increasing trust in, and satisfaction with their public service. Singapore’s civil service is reckoned to be one of the world’s best.
Tinubu must take the painful but necessary step of overhauling the civil service to make it more cost-effective and efficient. This task needs to be undertaken swiftly, resolutely, and objectively.
He should update and review the 2012 Oronsaye Report that recommended slashing the number of MDAs. With no thought to available resources or prospects, successive National Assemblies and presidents have recklessly created over 100 new agencies since then.        
Tunji Olaopa, a former federal permanent secretary, has urged the government focus on achieving cost-containment through rationalisation, and a smaller, flexible, and efficient civil service; re-professionalised and with the skill-competency required for democratic governance and service delivery.
A former UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, said, ‘’The sheer scale of the challenges that still face us – and the need to hold our own in a competitive world – mean that we need to change the way government works. It needs to be sharper and quicker; to be more agile, more focused on getting results.” Tinubu should run with this wisdom.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20031149/Umahi.jpg

The 3,617 RTCs it reported in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated an increase of 6.01 per cent from the previous quarter. Promptly, the Federal Road Safety Corps said it would work towards reducing road accidents by five per cent. The task however requires a holistic approach and collaboration among various tiers of government.
The Corps Marshal/CEO of the FRSC, Dauda Biu, at a workshop in Makurdi, Benue State,stated, “The corps will ensure complete realisation of five per cent reduction of road traffic deaths and injuries with the aid of improving capacity for data collection, analysis and management to enhance road safety policy formulation.”
Brave words, but RTCs are not abating although the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, said in September reported a 15.5 per cent decrease in fatalities this year compared to 2022.
Kazeem had earlier told the News Agency of Nigeria that 4,387 people died in RTCs across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, January to June 2023. These figures underscore the grim reality. 
Experts blame rising RTCs on weak traffic law enforcement. What often passes for enforcement in most cases is extortion. In Lagos and Ogun states, noticeably, federal and state enforcement agencies target mostly private vehicles whereas the worst traffic law violators are the commercial vehicle operators. While traffic officers harass private vehicles, so many dilapidated commercial vehicles freely ply the highways and are responsible for more crashes.
The deplorable state of roads nationwide contributes to the accidents and the harvest of deaths and injuries. A 2021 research published in the Asian Journal of Advanced Research and Reports stated that “Nigerian roads are characterised by potholes, gallops, slippery bumps, untarred roads, bushes, mud, stones and gravel which cause road accidents.”  Related News   Seven die in Osun, four in A’Ibom crashes  FRSC records 75 deaths in 353 Lagos road accidents in eight months   Two LAUTECH students, driver burnt to death in road crash   
The World Health Organisation said that the 41,693 deaths recorded via RTCs on Nigerian roads represented 2.82 per cent of the global total. Also, the World Bank ranked Nigeria 54th in the world in the number of road accidents.      
In addition to the decrepit road infrastructure, poor vehicle maintenance, recklessness among drivers, driving under the influence of alcohol, using telephones while driving, and excessive speeding, contribute immensely to the scale of RTCs in the country.
The WHO is also dismayed by the significant number of deaths among children and young adults. Approximately 1.35 million people die, and 50 million sustain injuries every year from RTCs worldwide, it added. While 93 per cent of road fatalities occur in low-and-middle-income nations, countries like Nigeria lose up to 3.0 per cent of their GDP to road accidents. The federal and state governments must therefore demonstrate strong commitment to reducing RTCs.
FRSC officers need to step up honest and vigorous enforcement. States need to do more; only Lagos and a handful of others have recognised the need for robust laws and traffic management agencies. They should professionalise, equip, fund, and motivate its traffic managers, and impose order and safety on the roads. The FRSC should restrict itself to federal roads.
The FRSC should be well-equipped and funded. Ambulance and other first responder services should be upgraded for efficiency by the various governments.
The roads should be maintained, and new ones constantly built. The vehicle insurance system should be reformed, and road safety laws and regulations perpetually enforced free of corruption and extortion.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/05181348/Road-accident1.png

Iyela Ajayi, Executive Secretary of the commission, urged state governments to establish counterpart agencies in their respective domains to enable them access funding support from NSSEC.
Education is very important for the development of any society. However, primary, and secondary education should be primarily the responsibility of states and local governments in a federation. Typically, central governments in federal countries provide support, including funding through grants.
Nigeria’s central government has also over the years been supportive of primary and secondary education. However, the reestablishment of NSSEC is wasteful, especially as the country is broke. Government should be radically downsizing, not creating new cost centres.
Already, the Federal Government has the Universal Basic Education Commission, and the Tertiary Education Trust Fund. The first provides funding and other support to primary education nationwide and in support of the Universal Basic Education Programme up to junior secondary school. TETFUND supports tertiary education institutions nationwide. 
The initial National Secondary Education Commission Act 2004 was to support the secondary school system nationwide. But junior secondary school was later assigned to basic education. NSSEC became operational only in April 2021.
Undoubtedly, the promoters of the amended NSSSEC Act 2023 seek to further strengthen secondary education. Their zeal is however misplaced; they should channel their energy into upgrading UBEC and avoid unnecessary costs and bureaucracy.
Like any other government agency, it will have HQs, regional/area offices, principal officers, and other staff, and incur personnel and running costs. Contracts will be awarded, and procurement a permanent endeavour. Like others, NSSEC has already been involved in scandal, just two years in operation, including the suspension of its pioneer head over allegations of administrative ineptitude and financial misappropriation.      
Nigeria’s leaders are addicted to waste, duplication, and costly bureaucracies. To support secondary education, all the government and the National Assembly should do is amend the UBEC Act and other relevant laws, expanding their scope to accommodate senior secondary education.  Related News   Education Commission to set minimum standards for English, Mathematics teachers  How states can access senior secondary fund – NSSEC  N57bn disbursed for teachers’ training in 13 years – UBEC   
But the law not only sets up another cost centre in Abuja, but also demands similar cost centres being established at the state level to qualify for its funds.
UBEC already supports basic education, from primary to the junior secondary school level. Instead of a new bureaucracy, the UBEC Act should simply be reworked to include senior secondary education.
The Director-General of the Budget Office of the Federation, Ben Akabueze, in August, said there were about 1.5 million workers on the federal payroll. The government has been borrowing since 2014 to meet payroll obligations.
An NGO, BudgIT, reported that federal personnel costs leaped from N1.8 trillion in 2017 to N2.1 trillion in 2018. Public servants make up just about one per cent of Nigeria’s population but consume a quarter of the national budget.
The President Bola Tinubu administration is reportedly seeking a fresh loan of $400 million for ‘cash transfer’ to poor households to cushion the effect of prevailing adversity. Money is scarce and should be conserved for critical infrastructure and poverty alleviation.
Moreover, the states should have control over primary and secondary education; an overbearing central government dictating standards to them is inappropriate. Standards should be mutually negotiated and agreed to by the states, and common grounds adopted.        
Tinubu should boldly scrap or merge irrelevant, duplicated and overlapping agencies to cut the cost of governance. NSSEC is one; he should take that pragmatic option.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/14024350/NSSEC-650x375-1.jpg

It reflects a lack of value for human dignity, and dysfunction in the criminal justice system. After conviction and passing of death sentences, the state governors, whose responsibility it is to sign death warrants, commute the sentence or pardon the convict, should stop shirking their constitutional responsibility and help decongest the custodial centres.
Generally, it is a tough task. Unlike autocracies, leaders in many democracies are reluctant to enforce the death penalty. Arguments over its rightness, effectiveness and fairness rage across the world. According to Amnesty International, by law or in practice, 112 countries have abolished the death penalty. Fifty-five countries, including Nigeria, retain the death penalty for capital offences in their statute books.
Advocates of abolition, including CSOs in Nigeria, have stepped up their campaign to scrap state-sanctioned execution. While that is ongoing however, the reality is that Nigerian law prescribes death for certain offences through the criminal justice system. The European Union Agency for Asylum lists murder, treason, assisted suicide, armed robbery, and fabricating false evidence leading to conviction to death of another person as offences attracting the death sentence in Nigeria.
Lately, death penalty for terrorism and kidnapping has been written into federal and state statutes. In the North, 12 states have adopted penal Sharia laws prescribing death sentences for certain “offences” not accepted by most of the world as crimes at all. This has strengthened the hands of anti-death penalty campaigners who view it as the ultimate violation of human rights. 
State governors are therefore conflicted. But the choice is clear. Like the president, the constitution empowers them with the prerogative of mercy; they can commute death sentences to imprisonment, release convicts on death row, or pardon them outright.
The alternative is to sign the death warrants, authorising execution of convicts, especially those who had exhausted their right to appeal, and their sentences had been confirmed by the Supreme Court. Liberal democrats and the United Nations stoutly oppose that option.
Inaction solves nothing. Nigeria’s prisons are unpardonably overcrowded. The Nigerian Correctional Service website reveals that there are 81,786 inmates nationwide, but only 25,411 have been convicted; leaving 56,365, representing 68.9 per cent, awaiting trial. Prison conditions are poor; overcrowded, unhygienic, and prone to contaminable diseases. The food is poor as well.        Related News   Spend N500m fines of inmates on welfare, Falana urges Tunji-Ojo  One escapes death in Ogun collapsed building  JUST IN: Death toll in Gaza rises to at least 1,354 — Hamas ministry   
Keeping persons sentenced to death interminably is also inhumane. There are 3,008 males and 61 females currently on death row, NCoS disclosed. NGOs say an IDR could remain in prison for more than 15 years. Statista disclosed that Nigerian courts pronounced 2,556 death sentences between 2010 and 2020.
Unlike in the United States whose 2,331 death row inmates as of December 2022 have multiple opportunities for release appeals, and regular review or clemency hearings, Nigeria’s death row inmates can only hope for reprieve from the infrequent, and ill-structured use of the mercy prerogative.
President Bola Tinubu and the Interior Minister, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, should make prison decongestion a priority. Previous functionaries promised but failed to do so. Tunji-Ojo’s recent promise to ensure the 4,000 inmates regain their freedom is a start.
Though other governors demur, a former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, in 2016, signed one death warrant. Former Delta State Governor, Emmanuel Uduaghan, pardoned three Inmates on death row following the recommendations by the state’s Advisory Council on the Prerogative of Mercy in 2014.
Tinubu and the governors should activate the mercy machinery. Thorough reviews should be taken of each IDR case, and options for clemency applied, including commutation to lesser sentences.
The awaiting trial population is scandalous; state governors and the state chief judges should take up this task with determination.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/03233915/Some-inmates.jpg

Over seven million more, according to the World Bank, are expected to join them this year.
There is hunger in the land; unprecedented hardship caused by decades of maladministration, poor economic management, incompetence, and corruption. Lately, some misapplied policies of government have worsened the situation. Externally, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine War have also taken their toll on the country and its over 200 million people.
But the blame for the rampant poverty in Nigeria falls squarely on its successive leadership; executive and legislative, and national and sub-national.
Poverty has been marching unrelentingly. In 2018, Nigeria overtook India as the World’s Poverty Capital, and held on to the title till 2021 before relinquishing back to the Asian country. Now, it is the second largest host of persons living in extreme poverty. The World Poverty Clock estimates the number of its extremely poor at 71 million. Using the UN threshold of $1.9 per day, Statista says 12 per cent of the global population in extreme poverty lives in Nigeria in 2023. 
There is no respite yet. UNICEF has warned that 25 million Nigerians are at risk of hunger this year. The inflation rate, according to the NBS, has climbed to 26.72 per cent, up from 25.8 per cent the previous month. Unemployment is 33.3 per cent, and 53.4 per cent in the critical youth segment.
Government at all levels must therefore take up the responsibility to lift Nigerians out of poverty.
The theme for this year’s IDEP, “Decent Work and Social Protection: Putting Dignity in Practice for All,” that aims for universal access to decent work and social protection to uphold human dignity for all people is very apt for Nigeria.      
Nigeria’s poor engage in casual labour with dehumanising working conditions, low pay, and lack of safety guidelines. This has resulted in injuries, ill-health, and even death of some.  Related News   Group distributes food items to 200 households in FCT  Nigeria has over two million unregistered pharmaceutical outlets, says PSN  Rashidi Yekini@60: 12 things to know about the late ‘goalsfather’   
People living in extreme poverty, many of whom work in the informal economy – unregistered, unrecognised, and unprotected under labour legislation- face difficult and dangerous conditions. Despite working long hours, they are unable to earn enough to support themselves and their families.
Nigeria’s poverty is self-inflicted. Abundant in natural and human resources, its successive Federal Governments have been inefficient, corrupt, and failed to drive the economy productively. Its sub-national governments are worse; indolent, wasteful, unproductive, and very corrupt. They revel in the perverse system of sharing crude oil revenue from a central pot instead of running productive, self-sufficient economies.
To reduce poverty, the central and state governments must devise effective policies to harness the country’s resources to create jobs and wealth. The 1999 Constitution that inhibits the states and creates an overbearing centre needs to be amended to unleash the states’ huge potential.
The billions being wasted on corruption-fuelled cash transfers should be channelled to MSMEs, agriculture, and emergency work and youth entrepreneurial support programmes.
In his first presidency 2003-2010, Ignacio Lula DaSilva’s cash-grant programme, Bolsa Familia, was accompanied by aid to small farmers, and labour and pension reforms that together reduced extreme poverty in Brazil from 12 per cent to 4.8 per cent and lifted 20 million persons out of poverty.
Reviving the economy requires stimulus spending, an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment inflow, and effective security through devolved law enforcement, adequate power supply, and massive support for agriculture, rural infrastructure, mining, start-ups and MSMEs.        
Eradicating poverty is urgent; all tiers of government should drive the process.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/14150236/Poverty.jpg

The IMF revised its earlier growth forecast for Nigeria for 2023 downwards from 3.2 per cent to 2.9 per cent, while the World Bank voiced fresh concern over rising debt. Among business operators, apprehension is mounting as adversity threatens many more enterprises.
Amid the uncertainties, the administration remains unsteady. Beyond broad statements of intent, no coherent economic plan has emerged. In the meantime, the economy worsens. Western agencies, and the organised private sector that applauded Tinubu’s stoppage of petrol subsidy, and the unification of the naira exchange rates are squirming.
The influential Financial Times of London admitted last week that his touted economic plans are not moving according to plan. While still praising the subsidy removal and the “shifting towards a market-driven exchange rate from the previously overvalued currency,” FT said, “but four months into his (Tinubu’s) presidency, there are signs of things going awry.”
That is putting it mildly: the naira plunged further at the parallel market midweek to exchange at N1,025 to the US$1; by weekend, it was N1,040-N1,050 to $1. In the energy sector, independent marketers pulled back from importing petrol, citing excessive costs fuelled by the high exchange rates and higher crude oil prices in the international market. Effectively, this restored the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited’s monopoly on imports. Chaos and subsidy may bounce back. 
Simultaneously, prices of diesel, kerosene, lubricants, and industrial and cooking gas spiked geometrically. Electricity tariff has gone up. Unemployment is rising, far above the reality-denying 4.1 per cent posted recently by the National Bureau of Statistics.
Inflation hit 25.8 per cent in September. OPS organs are warning of more job losses, and factory closures. The Nigerian Association of Small and Medium Enterprises said a combination of forex scarcity, energy prices, dumping of foreign products and others would kill SMEs. Inability to access forex, the Airline Operators of Nigeria lamented, guarantees more shutdowns.
Tinubu needs a master plan. Nigerians and businesses are distressed. A World Bank estimate of 7.1 million more Nigerians sliding into poverty after the subsidy removal is now feared to top 10 million persons.        Related News   Kaduna ex-senator, Sani,  opens up on Wike  Multiple taxation: Tinubu panel asks govt to drop 190 taxes, OPS blames states  Economy: FG, arrest the tailspin   
As The PUNCH had constantly canvassed, FT, IMF and others now agree that Tinubu should stop announcing policies without plans for their implementation and handling their fallout. His ministers are separately proclaiming plans, but no discernible overall coordinated plan weaving them together has emerged. While the administration touts, and cherry-picks some free market policies, it ignores the critical ‘low-hanging fruits.’
It is continuing the self-defeating template of wasting public funds on the four comatose public refineries, and the Ajaokuta Steel Company instead of immediate, transparent, and corruption-free privatisation. The evidence is crystal clear; reforms taken in isolation without simultaneous coordinated plans targeted at pulling down the inherent binding constraints arresting the economy will only deliver hardship.
To make his free-market actions deliver desired impact, Tinubu must immediately re-launch the privatisation programme; through outright asset sales, concessions and unfettering critical sectors like railways, mining and ports and airports.  He should enforce existing, and roll out more executive orders liberalising all economic sectors.
Institutions must be strengthened to deliver on their mandates. The Central Bank of Nigeria needs to radically retool its monetary policies to manage the naira, and tame interest and inflation rates. Without effective regulation of the money deposit banks and the bureaux de change, and tackling corruption, limited reforms will always backfire.
The NNPC requires total restructuring into a lean, efficient holding company and an investment subsidiary.
Tinubu should devise and implement a pragmatic master plan post-haste or have the economy collapse on his watch.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/11183908/Tinubu-signs.jpeg

The apex bank announced that it was raising dollar supply to the market and freeing importers to obtain forex from the official window. While its advocates have strong arguments justifying the unbanning, critics however fret over some items on the list.
The CBN explained that the change to the market policy will boost liquidity in the market, promising to intervene from time to time to ease challenges until liquidity improves.
When it imposed the ban in June 2015 (there were 41 items initially), the CBN clarified that it was to conserve scarce foreign exchange, and encourage domestic production, self-sufficiency, and exports.
Forex shortage has however worsened in eight years. The naira’s plunge accelerated since June this year when newly inaugurated President Bola Tinubu triggered a unification of the multiple exchange rates. At the weekend, the naira exchanged at N1,050 to US$1. 
Many businesses cannot secure forex for essential raw materials, machinery, and parts. SMEs report closures and layoffs and even the big corporations have taken hits.
The OPS has clamoured unceasingly for the lifting of the ban on direct forex sales for the 43 items. These include rice, cement, palm oil products, vegetable oils, processed meat, steel drums and pipes, tinned fish, wheelbarrows, vegetables, soap and cosmetics, cellophane wrappers, tomatoes, and tomato paste.
For the OPS, the ban was unnecessary. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria said 200 of its members were adversely affected while it lasted. It said it was ill-advised because some of the items are raw materials that are not locally available. Operators argued that the ban accentuated distortions in the forex market and contributed to the persistent divergence in rates between the official Importers and Exporters Window and the parallel market.      
The Centre for Promotion of Free Enterprise added that the blacklisting conflicted with the prevailing trade policy as the items were not under import prohibition at the time the ban was imposed.

Proponents of free trade, citing benefits such as providing access to quality and lower prices, wider markets, and efficiency in production and supply lines, fault such restrictions. The IMF insisted that the economy had become more complex, thereby making such restrictions ineffective.
Abebe Selassie, IMF’s Africa Department chief, asserted, “The best way to manage a modern economy is to have fiscal policy lever and monetary policy lever to use to affect the kind of policy outcome you want, rather than saying I don’t like these goods and so I don’t want it to come in.”
Really, against the unassailable benefits of free markets, most arguments collapse. Besides, partnering with the OPS is desirable.
However, Nigeria faces unprecedented hardship. It baffles many therefore that at a time of such acute scarcity, when critical sectors and sub-sectors are dollar-starved, producers will have to compete for forex with importers of toothpicks!
Agreed that the ideal is unfettered market access moderated by taxes and tariffs, but Nigeria suffers the twin handicaps of severe adversity, and institutional weaknesses.
The first dictates that only items used as intermediary products, and those essential to prevent hunger should have been allowed. But until the economy and the forex squeeze improve, items like toothpicks, clothing, kitchen utensils, tableware, wooden doors, meat, and vegetables should have remained restricted.        
Given prevailing institutional weaknesses, high job creating productive sectors may be further disadvantaged.
Tinubu and the CBN Governor, Yemi Cardoso, should therefore critically monitor events, and revisit the items on the list if found expedient.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/28080107/cbn.jpg

Since the transformation...,"<span class=""post-date""> 15th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/fg-should-revitalise-telecoms-sector/,  Punch Editorial Board,"AN urgent appeal from telecommunications industry operators to the House of Representatives to intervene in the challenges confronting the sector should be promptly addressed. Since the transformational reforms in 2001, the telecoms industry has been a major economic growth segment contributing strongly to GDP. Necessary measures should therefore be adopted to sustain that tempo.
Last week, the telcos, under the aegis of the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria, met with the House Committee on Communications. Led by Gbenga Adebayo, they listed several areas of concern. These include the refusal of the Federal Capital Development Authority to grant a building permit for infrastructure roll-out to service providers in Abuja, non-passage of the Critical National Information Infrastructure Bill into law, multiple taxation, levies and charges, and non-review of the pricing regulatory framework.
Thesecomplaints are not new. Indeed, for years, operators have campaigned vigorously for a more liberal operating environment. From both the executive and legislative arms, and the state governments, the complaints deserve scrutiny.
Adebayo added, “The 300 per cent increase in diesel costs, which was implemented at the beginning of the year, humongous indebtedness in the industry, lack of access to, and increased rate of foreign exchange to service their operations, dire levels of insecurity across the country with increased theft and damage to our members’ sites, have all prevented members from running their businesses efficiently and profitably.” 
Second only to the oil and gas sector, telecoms has consistently been a major attraction for Foreign Direct Investment. The Nigerian government needs to tackle the macroeconomic operating environment, paying particular attention to high cost of energy, and the foreign exchange market crisis, among others, that constrain businesses and productive activities.
President Bola Tinubu’s appointment of new CEOs of the regulatory agencies under the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy, on Thursday, should reenergise the industry. The Minister, Bosun Tijani, should drive a radical growth and development programme.
Nigeria has Africa’s largest mobile telephone market, accounting for 80 percent of the continent’s telecoms subscribers. Its telecoms market has been valued at $77 billion. These operators include mobile telephony, internet service providers, value-added service providers, vendors, tower companies, fixed telephony operators, and international data access service providers.      
According to Mordom Intelligence, the country’s telecoms market revenue is expected to grow to $8.68 billion in 2023 to $10.92 billion by 2028, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 4.70 per cent. In 2022, MTN Nigeria generated $4.5 billion revenue, compared to $2.98 billion generated by MTN South Africa, its parent company, according to Statista.
The immediate past Executive Vice-Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, said the sector’s contribution to GDP in the first quarter of this year was 14.13 per cent, while it added 16 per cent to the national GDP in Q2. In Q2 2022, it had attained 15 per cent. Danbatta said the industry had created over 500,000 jobs, and exported its expertise to other countries. Such a high income-generating sector should attract concerted efforts from the federal and state governments to sustain and accelerate its growth.
But operators fret. Apart from the general adversity in an economy buffeted by internal and external headwinds, the sector’s growth has been stifled by RoW levies, and other burdensome taxes, charges and levies imposed by state governments. States such as Lagos, Osun, and Oyo, and the FCT are reportedly charging far above the N145/linear metre endorsed by the Nigerian Governors’ Forum.  ALTON says this has prevented smaller operators from getting service from the Mobile Network Operators for onward transmission to other parts of the country.  Related News   UK, US, three others sign telecoms pact  UK broadband speed grows  MVNOs to crash telecoms cost, says expert   
Not only are local operators hampered by their inability to access foreign exchange through commercial banks for capital expenditure, but the instability in the parallel market, and poor regulations have also stymied the growth of the industry in Nigeria.
The NCC, in a 2022 document, disclosed that industry-wide, domestic investment was N785.7 billion as of December 2022, while operating costs were N2 trillion, against total revenue of N3.88 trillion. Some of the bottlenecks have been aggravated by the country’s prevailing adverse economic situation.
Unlike the big operators which can obtain foreign exchange from the official sources, the small firms are compelled to resort to the parallel market. In addition, government’s regulated voice and data tariff, which have remained unchanged for over 15 years despite the increase in the cost of energy, has been strangulating small players. Operators also cite the cost of borrowing, alongside the sharp increase in other expenditure, which they say have not matched pricing.
Some experts and consumer advocacy groups, while acknowledging the challenges of operators, nevertheless assert that Nigerian consumers pay comparatively higher prices for services. Complaints by consumers remain high; largely of unsatisfactory services and short-changing by operators across all segments of the industry.        
Regulators should look closer into these complaints. The operators’ service quality is a sore point among Nigerians. They must be compelled to improve through strict surveillance and enforcement of regulations and penalties.
However, for a sector that depends on terrestrial infrastructure, the quality of telecoms services in the country will continue to suffer due to the damage unleashed on public infrastructure. Insiders report that about 568 local telecoms firms have become inactive in the last five years. They warn that more could succumb to the harsh operating environment in the next few years unless deliberate actions are taken to salvage the marginal players.
The Federal Government and the NCC need to create additional incentives for the operators and enabling seamless access to forex.
Stamping out rampant insecurity should be a top priority for the national and sub-national governments. Attacks on, and vandalism of telecoms infrastructure have spiked in several parts of the country.
The multiple taxes levied on the operators should be creatively reviewed, with a view to incentivising investors, delivering lower prices to consumers, and at the same time, optimising fair tax returns to the government, and reducing poverty.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07185130/telecoms-mast.jpg
editorial,"Residents, demand explanations from Ogun LG chairmen","THE recent reminder by an elder statesman, Afe Babalola, of how state governments have pulverised the local governments by hijacking their allocations should provoke Nigerians to demand accountability...","<span class=""post-date""> 13th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/residents-demand-explanations-from-ogun-lg-chairmen/,  Punch Editorial Board,"THE recent reminder by an elder statesman, Afe Babalola, of how state governments have pulverised the local governments by hijacking their allocations should provoke Nigerians to demand accountability from their elected officials. An opportunity has arisen in Ogun State where the impeached Chairman of the Ijebu East Local Government, Wale Adedayo, accused Governor Dapo Abiodun of denying LGs their statutory funds only to be countered by the 19 other LG bosses. All stakeholders in the state should therefore demand an accounting from the council chiefs.
Babalola, a legal luminary, advised President Bola Tinubu to ensure that LGs received their allocations directly without interference or subversion from the state governments. He said, “I think the current president should do all he can to ensure that local government allocation gets to them directly and not through the governors because they (governors) steal a lot.”
Across the country, underdevelopment is prevalent as the LGs have become comatose, notorious for idleness. Their excuse, and confirmed by numerous agencies, is that state governors hijack their funds under diverse guises through the State/Local Government Joint Account.
Ogun State residents should seize this chance. Since 19 out of the state’s 20 LG chairman have declared emphatically that they have indeed been receiving their allocations from the Federation Account and other funds, they should render an account to the electorate. This is imperative as residents complain frequently of poor roads, lack of potable water, broken primary health care facilities and general hardship. Communities, opinion leaders, youth and women’s groups should mobilise to their respective LG HQs and demand answers from the LG chairmen. 
Disowning Adedayo, the other Ogun LG bosses went to Abeokuta, the state capital, to prostrate before Abiodun and beg for “forgiveness” for their colleague’s allegations. This gives the citizens leeway to demand details of appropriation, expenditure, and projects from them.
Adedayo, in an open letter to a party elder and copied to the anti-graft agencies, said the state government diverted the LGs’ statutory federal allocations between 2021 and 2023. He said the N10.8 billion funds for the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme were similarly diverted, while    the 10 per cent of the state’s internally generated revenue that should be disbursed to LGs by law were also withheld.  Related News   1,000 Ogun residents benefit from free eye care  Ogun LG boss slams residents’ ultimatum on allocation  Gunmen shoot three Ogun residents, three suspects arrested   
However, the 19 other Ogun LG chairmen insisted that LG funds were “transparently disbursed and managed between 2021 and 2023.”      
Some residents of the Ijebu Ode LGA issued a 48-hour ultimatum, demanding that their LG Chairman, Babatunde Emiola-Gazal, render an account of allocations accrued to the council or risk a protest. Other LGs’ residents, by diverse peaceful and lawful means, should follow suit.
In August, residents of Laderin, Olokuta, and Idi-Aba communities in Abeokuta South LGA, had lamented the hardship they encountered in accessing the Wole Soyinka train station in Abeokuta, due to the dilapidated road. Some residents of Olorunsogo in the Obafemi Owode LGA are reportedly moving out of the area due to the two-year-old power blackout.
But the state government recently stated that it disbursed N1.8 billion to the LGs for infrastructure and insists that it has been funding them over the years.
The Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation said the 36 states received N296 billion, and LGs N218 billion for June 2023. The states shared N1.4 trillion from the FAAC between January and June 2022.
Nigeria’s taxpayers must begin to constantly demand transparency and accountability from their state and local governments. That is what sustains democracy. Ogun provides a good starting point.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11103230/Ogun-State-Map-1.jpg
editorial,"Insecurity: Off-cycle elections will test Tinubu, police","STILL battling the fallout of the 2023 general elections, President Bola Tinubu, the Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, and the Independent National Electoral Commission face a fresh test ...","<span class=""post-date""> 13th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/insecurity-off-cycle-elections-will-test-tinubu-police/,  Punch Editorial Board,"STILL battling the fallout of the 2023 general elections, President Bola Tinubu, the Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, and the Independent National Electoral Commission face a fresh test with the imminent off-cycle governorship elections in Kogi, Imo and Bayelsa states. Already, INEC has expressed grave concerns over rising insecurity in those states ahead of the November 11 polls, with its National Commissioner, Information and Voter Education, Sam Olumekun, citing heightened violence among supporters of rival political parties.
Tinubu must prove his self-acclaimed democratic credentials by deploying ample security cover to safeguard lives and property. INEC, much maligned over the contentious 2023 polls, must get its logistics, planning and tools right this time. Egbetokun should deliver on his promise to destroy insecurity.
Free and fair elections, devoid of manipulation and violence, are recognised as a basic pillar of democracy. USAID declares, “A country cannot be truly democratic until its citizens have the opportunity to choose their representatives through elections that are free and fair.” Nigeria’s experiment with democracy has been fraught; its elections marred by manipulation, violence, votes falsification and poor management. The best that can be said is that it has endured for 24 years, the longest period of civilian rule since independence in 1960.
But violence is a constant. Human Rights Watch observed that Nigeria’s “epidemic of political violence,” actual and threatened, restricts the ability of ordinary voters to participate and allows politicians to subvert the electoral process. The Centre for Democracy and Development tallied 109 persons killed across the country in election-related violence January to March 10, this year. Kimpact Development Initiative said 28 persons died in 238 violent incidents during the voting; many more died in clashes, attacks and shootings prior to the polling. 
This has been the pattern since 1999. Tinubu should task the police and other security agencies to stamp out violence. The thugs, hoodlums, arsonists, assassins and ballot box snatchers should be neutralised. The politicians, including public office holders that fund, equip and direct them, should be identified and prosecuted. Even war-ravaged countries like Afghanistan and Iraq hold peaceful elections, helped by effective security measures.
The three states holding elections have track records of political violence and insecurity. CDD said Kogi witnessed 10 deaths and 79 cases of violence and election malpractices during the 2019 governorship election. Its romance with political violence harks far back to the aborted Third Republic when Alifa Daniel, a correspondent of the defunct National Concord, was doused with acid by political thugs.  Related News   Tinubu seeks Senate's confirmation of ICPC chairman, others  JUST IN: Tinubu approves N18bn assurance policy for fallen heroes' families  Tinubu, prosecute Bawa or release him   
In Imo, secessionists driving a terror campaign of killings, arson, and kidnapping, and imposing sit-at-home curfews, have staged election-related violence. Gunmen have attacked and razed INEC offices and killed its personnel. Parts of Orsu, Orlu, Njaba and Okigwe LGAs have reportedly become ungovernable. In December 2022, the Labour Party candidate for the Onuimo LGA Constituency, Christopher Elehu, was brutally killed. In February 2023, David Uche of the Young Progressives Party was also killed in front of his house in Isiala Mbano LGA.      
Bayelsa, where militancy, criminality and politics have conflated, presents an environment that sabotages free and fair elections. Elections there are warfare. During the 2019 election, the then-Governor Seriake Dickson disclosed that 10 party members were “beheaded, mutilated and butchered.” Nembe, Brass, Southern Ijaw and Ekeremor LGAs have been identified for pervasive electoral violence. INEC postponed elections in four wards and 141 polling units after hoodlums disrupted voting during the March polls.
Apathy reigns. INEC said over 241,715 voters failed to collect their Permanent Voter Cards in Kogi, Imo, and Bayelsa by the October 9 deadline.
INEC should perfect its logistics and preparations. The greater challenge falls on the police and other security agencies. They must be professional, efficient, and neutral. They should pre-empt and stamp out violence and malpractices and make the three states safe for voting. 
Tinubu should ensure that they do so.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/11191034/Delta-bye-election.jpg

In the early hours of October 7, militants of the Palestinian Hamas group launched coordinated surprise attacks of unprecedented scale on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip. The incursion by land, sea, and air and an associated barrage of missiles resulted in hundreds of deaths, prompting Israeli retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza that killed hundreds more, setting off a potential escalatory spiral that may draw in many more belligerents.
The Israel-Hamas confrontation is just the latest episode in a complex and long-standing conflict that defies simple solutions. Historical, political, religious, and territorial factors conflate, leading to decades of tension, violence, and suffering. Achieving lasting peace requires addressing the root causes of the conflict, and ensuring the rights and security of all parties involved.
There are two paths; one, guaranteed to provoke wars, favoured by Iran, and its proxies – Hamas, Hezbollah, and other extremist factions and terror groups—insists on wiping Israel off the map.
Another, promoted by the United Nations, the United States and its allies, and supported by pragmatic Arab nations like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait prefer a lasting consensus-based peace anchored on an independent state for the Palestinian people side-by-side recognising the right of Israel to exist within its pre-1967 borders. 
Twenty-one years ago, Saudi Arabia put considerable diplomatic effort into the Arab Peace Initiative, a proposal that unified Arab states in finally offering Israel recognition, regional legitimacy and security in exchange for some concessions. This blueprint is supported by the US President Joe Biden administration.
But hardliners on both sides have been frustrating peace moves. Encouraged by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, far-right Jews in Israel; and on the other side, fanatical Arabs, Syria, Islamist fanatics and terrorists, all backed, funded, armed and trained by Iran, a non-Arab state, that seeks Israel’s annihilation, persistently create tension.
Experts believe that Iran and Hamas sprung the long-planned assault to derail ongoing peace talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia. A successful settlement of the Palestinian issue threatens Iran’s strategy of fomenting perpetual violence in the Middle-East through a network of militant proxies from Yemen to Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.        Related News   Israel-Hamas war: Gaza death toll rises to 2,215  Gazans flee homes as Israeli ground invasion looms  Israeli forces continue Gaza Strip bombardment, mass troops on border   
The world should rally to stop the war. Already, the US, whose citizens have also been killed and held hostage, has pledged full support for Israel and dispatched a naval Carrier Strike Group to the region. Russia, China, and North Korea are only too glad to muddy the waters; Russia, to divert attention and Western assets away from helping the beleaguered Ukraine which it invaded 20 months ago; China, to similarly shift US help away from Taiwan; and North Korea, to sell weapons to Israel’s enemies to help its own sinking economy, and annoy the US.
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other Arab states should mobilise other countries to broker a ceasefire and resume peace talks. The majority of people on both sides want peace; together, they should defeat the purveyors of violence. There should be an immediate ceasefire and supply of humanitarian aid. Those who perpetrated war crimes should be brought to justice.  Hamas must be made to release the hostages.
Palestinian factions should unite for peace. There should be efforts to demilitarise Gaza and lift the Israeli blockade.
The international community should step up efforts to realise the two-state solution. Palestinians must have a state of their own; Israel needs security guarantees.
Israelis should repudiate the hardliners and religious fanatics in their midst who have been violating existing treaties, UN resolutions, and occupying Arab land.
The world is battling several such conflagrations, including the Russian aggression on Ukraine, this war should not escalate.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/31115340/000_P3038.jpg
editorial,Citizen Greatness must not die in vain,"ALLEGATIONS that a young woman, Greatness Olorunfemi, a victim of traffic robbery in Abuja, died after being denied treatment for lack of a police report, are disturbing. Greatness was robbed, stabbed...","<span class=""post-date""> 12th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/citizen-greatness-must-not-die-in-vain/,  Punch Editorial Board,"ALLEGATIONS that a young woman, Greatness Olorunfemi, a victim of traffic robbery in Abuja, died after being denied treatment for lack of a police report, are disturbing. Greatness was robbed, stabbed, and thrown out of a moving commercial vehicle on the Maitama-Kubwa highway. She reportedly died shortly after she was rushed to a public hospital in the Federal Capital Territory. Her tragic death has triggered public ire, and probes by the Nigeria Police and the FCT authorities. The investigations should be thorough; unravel the circumstances, and her killers apprehended and prosecuted.
More than two weeks after, it is yet unclear how exactly Greatness eventually died – whether she died before reaching the hospital, or whether as alleged, the insistence on a police report before treatment by the medical personnel cost the lady her life. If the latter is established, it is a violation of the law, and the medical officials and the hospital have criminal cases to answer.
For a country with a high crime and traffic accident rates, it is absurd for hospitals to reject violence and accident victims. In the United States, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labour Act 1986 stipulates treatment for such emergencies even without payment.
Like Greatness, many Nigerians have died from negligence by medical personnel insisting on a police report before treatment. The excuse – which carried weight in the past – was that police harassed and blackmailed doctors who treated gunshot wounds. But the authorities have since addressed the anomaly. 
The National Health Act 2014 classifies it an offence to deny a patient treatment, mandating a fine of N100,000, or jail term of six months or both upon conviction. That law was obeyed in the breach. In August 2016, four medical doctors travelling to Sokoto State were involved in a road accident in Kaduna State. Two of them survived initially. But at the hospital, they were denied treatment because there was no police report! All the four perished.
Similar needless loss of lives due to the insistence on police report persisted. In response, the immediate past president, Muhammadu Buhari, signed the Compulsory Treatment and Care of Victims of Gunshot Act 2017. The police hierarchy have repeatedly announced that a police report is not required for treatment of gunshot victims.  Related News   Hospital rejection sending many to early grave despite law  Enforcing emergency medical treatment laws  Abuja ‘one-chance’ victim planned to begin PhD in 2024 – Father   
According to the Lagos State Police Command spokesman, Benjamin Hundeyin, officers on an early morning patrol in 2022 found a man involved in a motor accident. They took him to five different public hospitals; the first four rejected him because there was no police report. The fourth asked the officers to bring N1 million before treatment. Hundeyin lamented the frequency of such behaviour by medical personnel. If this could happen to the police, the fate of ordinary Nigerians is better left to distressing imagination.      
Greatness’ case must be the impetus for the rigorous implementation of the law going forward. The Acting Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, should ensure that police personnel adhere strictly to the law. The Coordinating Minister of Health, Mohammed Pate, should engage the entire health community; regulators and professional associations, and collaborate with the police to end the practice.
The primary function of medical personnel is to save lives. Medical workers who deny patients treatment should face both regulatory and criminal sanctions. Police officers who harass medical personnel for doing their duty should be prosecuted, and thereafter flushed out of the Force.
The Nigerian Medical Association and other professional bodies should take up the issue. The NMA should liaise with its members to report to the police all treatment administered on gunshot victims.
Greatness must not die in vain; those who wasted her precious life should be apprehended and prosecuted.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/10011508/Greatness-Olorunfemi-2-e1696896908144.jpeg
editorial,"FG, states; improve the lot of the girl-child","AS the world marks the International Day of the Girl-Child today, Nigeria’s national and sub-national governments should redouble efforts to improve the conditions of the country’s female children...","<span class=""post-date""> 11th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/fg-states-improve-the-lot-of-the-girl-child/,  Punch Editorial Board,"AS the world marks the International Day of the Girl-Child today, Nigeria’s national and sub-national governments should redouble efforts to improve the conditions of the country’s female children. Reports paint a picture of pain and trauma for many Nigerian girls; discriminated against in access to education, food and nutrition, married off at early ages, and limited in career opportunities.
Observed since 2012 to be marked every October 11, the ‘Day of Girls’ seeks to increase awareness of gender inequality faced by girls worldwide, “including in access to education, nutrition, legal rights, medical care, and protection from violence, and forced marriage,” the United Nations explained.
UNICEF said that 50 per cent of girls in Nigeria are not attending school, due among others to domestic violence, pregnancy, child labour, insecurity, and hunger. All stakeholders should work to make life more meaningful for the female child.
According to the ‘UN Women,’ girls and women are very important to the development and wellbeing of every society. It said, “Girls play multiple roles in the household, society and the economy.” Therefore, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the UN Millennium Development Goals, among others, target increasing equality between girls’ and boys’ educational attainment. 
One major way to improve the prospects of the girl-child is education, and here, Nigeria falters. A UNICEF representative, Jutaro Sakamoto, recently disclosed that 7.6 million Nigerian girls are out-of-school, representing 3.9 million at the primary school level, and 3.7 million at the junior secondary level. Of this, 48 per cent are in the North-West and North-East.
Last year, the Federal Government said Nigeria’s illiteracy rate had dropped to 31 per cent, down from 38 per cent in 2015. Still, this suggested that 76 million were un-schooled. CountryMeters puts the literacy rate at 59.6 per cent, and the UN at 62 per cent. Literacy rate for adults is 69.19 per cent, and 49.68 per cent among adult women.
UNESCO says Nigeria now has 20.2 million children OOS, over 60 per cent of them girls. In 2022, UNIICEF said of the 18.5 million OOS population then, over 10 million of them were girls.        Related News   IPPIS: FG to stop salaries of unverified workers Friday  FG okays $3.45bn W’Bank loan application for power, others  Prioritise STEM courses, FG urges tertiary institutions   
The world waits for Nigeria to address the situation as it accounts for 15 per cent of all OOS children globally, majority of them girls. Sakamoto said, “If we can’t address the situation in Nigeria, we can’t solve the situation in the world.” State governments should take up this challenge.
Terrorists and bandits now habitually kidnap female students since the abduction in 2014 of 276 schoolgirls in Chibok, Borno State. This, as well as rape, early marriage, banditry, conflicts, and domestic violence have further discouraged female education.
State governments should embark on mass education, implement the Child Rights Act to the fullest, and discourage child marriage, child labour and abuse.
Education is the bedrock of any society; the key to the future. UNICEF insists that investing in girls’ education up to secondary level drives national growth rate, reduces child mortality and maternal mortality, reduces stunting rates, and increases the lifetime earnings of girls and their families dramatically.
Nigeria currently has the highest number of child brides in Africa, and the third highest globally after India and Bangladesh.
To make this day impactful, the UN recommends adoption of policies to achieve effective promotion of girl-child education, gender equality, and end violence against girls, support girls health, and mentoring of girls.
The various governments, educators, community leaders, faith-based organisations, non-profits and advocacy groups should vigorously pursue these objectives.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31235017/Girl-Child.jpg
editorial,Aviation sector overdue for drastic reforms,THE Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority’s recent amendment to its regulations mandating domestic airlines to expand their fleets to a minimum of six aircraft by January 2025 requires deeper scrutiny. ...,"<span class=""post-date""> 11th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/aviation-sector-overdue-for-drastic-reforms/,  Punch Editorial Board,"THE Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority’s recent amendment to its regulations mandating domestic airlines to expand their fleets to a minimum of six aircraft by January 2025 requires deeper scrutiny. Nigeria currently has 23 registered domestic carriers, says NCAA, but only a few are flying regularly. Most are struggling to remain aloft. Nigeria’s aviation sector needs drastic reforms to tackle deep-rooted problems and stimulate a vibrant operating environment. Festus Keyamo, the Minister for Aviation, should vigorously drive that process.
The rule requires new entrants to start with at least six aircraft, and existing ones to raise their fleets to six, or merge with others to reach that number.
While the NCAA rule attempts to drive competition, improve capacity and efficiency, it merely scratches the surface. The problems besetting the sector are deeper, long-standing and daunting; they require extensive strategising, and root-and-branch reforms. President Bola Tinubu and Keyamo should initiate them.
A properly functioning market-led, private sector-dominated aviation sector does not need a regulator dictating fleet sizes for private businesses. Tinubu and Keyamo should single-mindedly pursue liberalisation, privatisation and concessions and unleash the sector’s enormous potential. 
Experts have identified lack of a coherent air transport policy, bad management, decrepit infrastructure, lax security, corruption and political interference among factors crippling Nigeria’s aviation sector. Johannesburg-based Centurion Law Group identifies “institutional, structural and regulatory challenges” constraining it and discouraging investment.
Yet, the civil aviation industry is a critical player in the global economy. Among its uses, declared the OECD, “it reduces the cost of trade, and facilitates tourism and the smooth operations of supply chains across continents.” Invariably, being complementary and substitutable with other transportation modes, it promotes integration and rapid development domestically, and on a global scale.
The International Air Transport Organisation says that globally, the aviation industry transports one-third of the value of goods and services, generates $111 billion in tax revenues, contributes 4.1 per cent to GDP, and provides 87.7 million jobs.      
Nigeria is missing out. The IATA estimates that aviation supports $63 billion in economic activity in Africa, and millions of jobs. South Africa accounts for over $12billion, 490,000 jobs and 3.5 per cent of the country’s GDP. In Egypt, aviation produces $7 billion in gross value added, supports 602,000 jobs, and adds 2.1 per cent to GDP.  Related News   Aviation sector preparing for safety audit  — NSIB  Aviation sector needs complete overhaul –Ex-NAMA CEO  Make Nigeria regional aviation hub   
Against this, Nigeria’s aviation industry’s gross value contribution is just $1.7 billion, and supports 241,000 jobs. It contributes a mere 0.4 per cent to GDP. 
But its potential is huge. The government neither has the resources to upgrade infrastructure nor the discipline to drive massive, modern infrastructure projects. It should therefore privatise the international airports transparently and urgently to reputable international operators as many countries have done and reaped immense benefits. The opaque one undertaken in the twilight of the Muhammadu Buhari administration should be reviewed.
Problems of multiple taxes and charges, and remittance of revenue by airlines should be resolved. The regulatory agencies should be reformed, imbued with efficiency, merit-based appointments and promotions, and cleansed of corruption.
Despite charges rated as one of the world’s highest, Nigeria’s airports are disgraceful, discouraging investors and tourists. They are poorly maintained, while corruption and disorderliness reign.
Airline operators struggle to access foreign exchange for their operations. They struggle to adequately maintain their aircraft due to unavailability of spare parts and hangars. Scarcity of aviation fuel adds to costs. High debt profiles, low patronage and poor customer services frustrate stakeholders.
Privatisation is the way to go. In the UK, Global Infrastructure Partners, led by Nigerian-born Adebayo Ogunlesi, acquired London Gatwick Airport, and Edinburgh Airport, and secured a long-term lease on Teesside Airport. Infrastructure revitalisation, improved passenger experience and increased efficiency resulted. Spain, Qatar, and Singapore among others have also privatised unprofitable airports.        
Tinubu and Keyamo should follow suit or like their predecessors, also fail woefully to revive the aviation sector.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/21144405/Nigerian-Civil-Aviation-Authority-700x336.jpg

Quoting a Defence Headquarters document, The PUNCH reported that military forces seized about 5,154 munitions from various theatres of operation between June and September this year. This demonstrates that the security agencies have so far failed to curb the decades-long illegal inflow of these instruments of death and mayhem. President Bola Tinubu’s administration must work harder to stop it.
The influx of small arms and light weapons has been a long-standing issue that has seriously compounded the insecurity in the country. This typically refers to as rifles, handguns, machine guns, and grenades.
Illegal weapons in the hands of non-state actors fuel the banditry and terrorism ravaging the North-West, North-East, and North-Central regions, as well as the terrorism in the South-East, militancy and vandalism in the South-South, and cult/gang violence in the South-West.
Geneva-based Small Arms Survey estimates that worldwide, more than 857 million SALWs are currently in circulation apart from 12 billion rounds of ammunition produced annually. Of these, 10 million SALWs are estimated to be in Africa; one million of these are in Nigeria. Ongoing conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Chad, Niger, Mali, and Libya goad the arms invasion. 
A report found that 17 per cent of the weapons seized from Boko Haram-linked rebels were diverted from the stockpiles in Chad, Niger and Nigeria. These weapons add to the caches illegally trafficked into, or through Libya, Burkina Faso, and Mali; smuggled handguns and shotguns sold on the black market, and diversion of legally imported firearms and explosives within the sub-Saharan Africa region.
The Russian war on Ukraine also aids the dispersal of dangerous weapons from the conflict zone to various parts of the continent, further stoking insecurity, criminality, and displacement.  Related News   Bandits kill Imam in Kaduna mosque attack  Bandits kill two in Kaduna fuel station attack  Soldiers kill terrorists in Sokoto village raid   
The volume of illicit weapons in Nigeria is frightening and exposes Nigeria’s weak centralised security system. Lack of state and local level policing, and the absence of adequate punishment for the traffickers hinder interdiction. The situation is not helped by the large swathes of unmanned, illegal and porous borders. The National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons in February said it recovered over 10,000 SALWs from non-state actors.      
Tougher measures, including going after the arms barons, the corrupt security operatives aiding them, and improving border security are required.
In January 2022, the Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation reported that about 178,459 different types of arms and ammunition were missing from the Nigeria Police armouries in 2019. The report, submitted to the National Assembly, disclosed that 88,078 of the missing arms were AK-47 rifles, and 3,907 other assorted rifles and pistols from different police formations nationwide.
Alarmingly, the missing armaments have not been found, and worse; no one has been held responsible for the dangerous heist, 22 months later. This is unacceptable. The law enforcement agencies must do more to curtail arms smuggling. There should be urgent collaborative actions by the border control agencies and other security services to stop the trafficking and circulation of all illegal weapons.
At the regional level, the African Union and the countries of the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, should establish common platforms and collaborate to track and trace illegal weapons.
Importantly, there should be a vigorous crackdown on arms traffickers through effective law enforcement and swift, diligent prosecution. The inflow of SALWs is so dangerous; the government should take it more seriously.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14004107/Firearms.jpg

After visiting parts of the state to inspect the Blue Line and Red Line railway systems, the governor ordered the clearing of shops and shanties abutting the rail lines, and traders encroaching on the roads. Already, the roads and rail lines in several parts of the state are being cleared, restoring some decency in those corridors. The greater challenge is for Sanwo-Olu to sustain the momentum.
After the state’s Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Tokunbo Wahab, proclaimed a “total ban on street trading, hawking, building illegal structures on drainage systems, and displaying of wares on walkways across the state,” enforcement began. Traders have been evicted from CMD/Magodo, Agege, points on the Lagos-Badagry Expressway and Yaba, and their wares seized.
Street trading is prevalent in Lagos. At bus-stops and roundabouts, pedestrian bridges, major and secondary roads, traders struggle for space with motorists and commuters. They obstruct traffic and pedestrians, and constitute a major environmental nuisance, contributing greatly to the city’s ill-repute for filth. Traders and their patrons generate tons of refuse, some of which block the drainages and roads. This contributes to flash flooding, and escalates the risk of infectious diseases spreading, and epidemics.
Traders and patrons urinate and defecate openly. Nigeria, with 47 million open defecators, is the second worst country in the world plagued by open defecation, according to UNICEF. 
Street trading also abets crime. The emergency markets harbour criminals; pickpockets, traffic robbers, and armed robbers. Some criminals double as traders, hide arms under their wares, and rob motorists and commuters. The markets are also centres for vending fake, expired, and dangerous products, including illicit drugs.
The activities of traders under Lagos bridges have caused fire incidents, including at Apongbon, Ijora and Iganmu. These are enough reasons to eradicate the nuisance permanently.
In the past eight years, street traders have aggressively returned to the roads after Akinwumi Ambode, who succeeded Babatunde Fashola as governor in 2011, relaxed enforcement. In Sanwo-Olu’s first term, enforcement became even weaker. Several half-hearted attempts to restore sanity faltered on the altar of politics and negligence.        Related News   Activists urge LASG to enforce ban on street trading  Lateef Jakande Leadership Academy gets new executive secretary  Somalia bans TikTok, Telegram over 'horrific content'   
Consequently, street traders, hawkers, wheelbarrow pushers and cart pushers have inundated the nooks and crannies of Lagos. Even around mega market complexes like the Tejuoso and Oyingbo– and some others rebuilt by the government and developers – street traders and hawkers still flourish, crippling businesses and transportation. Local Government officials compound the remiss by extorting money from them.
Markets in Lagos are dirty, roads are shabby, drainage is clogged and refuse mounds persist. All these and trading on the streets, bus stops, rail lines and bus terminals should be eradicated. The reality today is at variance with the government’s smart megacity aspiration.
The state’s 57 local councils should launch massive market provision schemes to address the shortage of markets.
Responsible city governments don’t allow illegal street trading. The United Kingdom Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 regulates structured street markets. The trader gets a renewable licence, and can only trade on specific days, and at specific times. Infractions attract fines of up to £1,000 (about N1.2 million).Singapore has strict anti-street hawking laws and strong penalties for offenders; its ‘Street Hawking Scheme’ is a highly regulated structured street trading programme specifying items to be sold, locations, age, and physical fitness of licensees.
Therefore, Lagos must enforce the ban in totality and consistently. Officials should monitor compliance throughout the day. LGs and the state government should build more markets equipped with necessary facilities for traders and shoppers.
Sanwo-Olu should leave Lagos better than he met it; clearing the streets is part of that process.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/27111422/Street-Trading-In-Lagos-Hawking-hawkers.jpg

President Bola Tinubu had exacerbated Nigeria’s decades-old energy sector crisis when he abruptly stopped the petrol subsidy and initiated a devaluation of the naira on assumption of office. This triggered unprecedented inflation and sent the economy into a tailspin and millions more into poverty. Selling the refineries outright immediately to promote domestic refining is the only route to sustainably solving the refined petroleum products crisis. Tinubu should quickly and decisively drive the process.
For decades, this newspaper has argued that the permanent and cost-effective solution to the Nigeria’s downstream petroleum sector – ending import dependence, crippling state subsidies, shortages, and massive fraud – is achieving private sector-led national self-sufficiency in refining.
Oyedele’s take that it is better for the government to sell the refineries outright is on target. Its benefits to the economy are incalculable.
Tinubu, a former oil sector executive, baffles observers by tolerating the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited’s expensive rigmarole. Presently, it is engaged yet another “turnaround maintenance,” for which it said it had borrowed $1.5 billion. This charade has gone on for too long. Nigeria is a major crude oil producer yet spends billions of dollars each year importing refined products, billions more on subsidies, bridging costs, and running four idle loss-making refineries, 5,001 kilometres of pipelines, and 21 depots across the country. 
For decades, instead of successive governments to pursue privatisation of the refineries, pipelines, and depots with single-minded determination to refine locally, they have focussed on subsidies. Organised labour is also confused; it wants the government that has proved incapable over the years, to retain ownership of the same refineries it has corruptly, ineptly, and consistently run aground.
Retrogression persists. Instantly, marketers and labour attacked Oyedele’s position. At an Independence Day summit, Oyedele had argued, “If Nigerian refineries process crude oil, unless we deal with our inefficiency, one litre of petrol will be the most expensive in the world. You would have succeeded in replacing the subsidy at the pump with subsidy of the refineries.” Nobody wants higher fuel prices. Following the subsidy stoppage and the naira’s free fall, petrol prices hover between N565 and N630 per litre; and diesel and kerosene at over N1,000 each per litre.  Related News   Senate probes N11.35tn spent on rehabilitation of refineries  Marketers await FG’s promise on refineries, defer fuel imports  FG not meeting modular refineries’ crude oil requirements – Operators   
Oyedele recalled that previous TAM contracts all failed. The National Assembly said N10 trillion had been wasted on TAMs, and Nigeria is still heavily import-dependent on refined products. Central Bank of Nigeria data shows the cost of petroleum products imports multiplied over a five-year period from $8.4 billion in 2017, to $16.2 billion, before increasing to $23.3 billion by 2022.      
Currently, Nigeria is the world’s 15th largest crude producer, oscillating between 1.2 million barrels per day, and 1.6 mbpd, according to the NNPC, but shamelessly imports refined products. This has necessitated a corrupt petrol subsidy regime that gulped N4.39 trillion in 2022, and N3.36 trillion in first half of 2023.
But private investors know how to optimise their investments. The United States government owns none of the currently operating 129 refineries (per Energy Information Administration) there, which the private sector runs efficiently. Singapore, which produces just 20,170 bpd, refines 1.5 million bpd.
Retaining the loss-making refineries makes no economic sense. Immediate and transparent privatisation will facilitate private foreign and domestic investment, latest technology acquisition, create jobs, and end the huge waste of public funds on them, end the depletion of foreign reserves on imports, foster competition, and generate productive activities and tax income all through the value chain.
Previous Petroleum Ministers and other experts all agreed that the refineries are moribund and should be sold. Achieving self-sufficiency in refining in the shortest possible time should be a national emergency.
Tinubu should stop the NNPC’s costly gymnastics and sell those refineries outright to competent investors with track record in refining immediately and halt Nigeria’s agony and shame.",https://cdn.punchng.com/2021/03/Port-Harcourt-refinery.jpg

With over 133 million multidimensionally poor people in the country, an ever-increasing inflation rate, and all-round hardship occasioned by ill-timed policies and misuse of government funds at all levels, the Nigerian child is bearing the brunt. The alarming spread of misery needs to be halted by effective economic and social policies.
Poverty rages more furiously following the petrol subsidy stoppage in June and the crash of the naira at the foreign exchange market. About 7.1 million more persons are consequently joining the extremely poor bracket this year, says the World Bank. Inflation is at an all-time high, hitting 25.8 per cent in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The naira is drowning, trading at over N1,000 to $1. Overall, the economy is in the doldrums while the government of President Bola Tinubu appears increasingly at sea.
Hardship has hit millions of households, and children are bearing the brunt. The federal and state governments need to act quickly to rescue the Nigerian child. In 2022, UNESCO estimated the country’s out-of-school children at 20 million, the second highest in the world. With the recent increments in fees and levies, more children are expected to drop out of school.
The International Labour Organisation said Nigeria contributed over 15 million children to the 160 million children actively engaged in child labour globally. Nigerian children face debilitating conditions as they are engaged in artisanal mining, as domestic workers and as child beggars. An NOI survey revealed that six out of every 10 Nigerian children have experienced a form of violence before reaching 18 years. Experts say poor children are most vulnerable to peer pressure and easily enticed into bad behaviour, from drug to gang violence and terrorism. 
The various governments must improve the welfare of Nigerian households so that vulnerable children can have better lives and access to basic social amenities.  Related News   Basic education investment yielding poor results – Minister  FG okays $3.45bn W’Bank loan application for power, others  FG approves $3.45bn W'Bank loan application for power, others   
The World Bank says extreme child poverty is more prevalent in fragile and conflict-prone settings like Nigeria’s northern states. While just 10.1 per cent of children in more stable countries live in extremely poor households, 38.6 per cent of children in fragile and conflict-afflicted states live in wretchedly poor households.
The insecurity ravaging the North and the South-East must be neutralised. The mental health and physical welfare of the child should be protected.      
According to UNICEF, 37 per cent of Nigerian children, approximately six million children, are stunted (chronically malnourished or low height for age), more than half of them severely. In addition, 18 per cent of children suffer from wasting (acutely malnourished or low weight for height), half of them severely. All these are because the child does not have the needed nutrients for normal growth and development. Research has shown that malnourished children will not be able to reach their full potential.
The Global Nutrition Report said Gabon, Ghana, and Togo have made some progress in reducing stunting for under-5s. With 17 per cent, 19 per cent, and 23.8 per cent respectively, the three countries have achieved lower than the African average of 30.7 per cent.
Giving out cups of rice and beans as palliative to a few is inadequate. Tinubu and the state governors should separately stimulate the economy and increase spending on social services to give the Nigerian child hope and a more palatable future.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/03144038/Hungry-children.fw_.png

In Borno, Governor Babagana Zulum announced a new plan to build 1,000 housing units for civil servants, while in Ogun, Governor Dapo Abiodun unveiled 200 newly built housing units for the public. With a national housing deficit assessed variously at 15 to 30 million units, such initiatives are negligible. Providing affordable housing for all requires more extensive initiatives by the various governments.
Shelter is acknowledged as a basic necessity along with food and clothing. Ending poverty declares Habitat for Humanity, an NGO, “starts with every human being having access to a safe and decent place to live.” Responsible governments all over the world therefore prioritise the provision of decent accommodation for the citizens.
However, the situation in Nigeria is the reverse. Successive governments have for over four decades neglected this responsibility. Experts say only about 20 per cent of Nigeria’s 216 million citizens are homeowners, leaving an estimated 28 million housing deficit currently, and will require about N21 trillion to close.
While governments are encouraged to seek solutions, building exclusively for civil servants as Zulum is doing is discriminatory. This class constitute less than two per cent of the population and is in no way more important than non-government workers. Abiodun’s 200 units are infinitesimal to make the slightest dent on the deficit. 
Left to their fate, citizens therefore rely overwhelmingly on personal funds to build houses, unlike in other societies, where governments emplace robust housing financing mechanisms with long-term mortgages to enable people to have decent accommodation. In the United States, United Kingdom, China and other nations in Europe, and Asia, citizens need not build houses on their own, but can buy those provided by the government, and private developers using convenient mortgage facilities.
Nigeria’s national and sub-national governments need to recognise housing as a priority and adopt realistic policies accordingly. The immediate past federal administration built 2,937 units under its National Housing Programme in 34 states by February 2022, but these are grossly inadequate.   Related News   South-West govs visit Akeredolu in Ibadan  Abiodun inspects cargo airport, says operations start Dec  Ogun gov promises to remain accountable   
There should be stronger private sector participation. Efforts to build a strong, resilient mortgage finance sector that collapsed years ago should be revived. The ideal is to facilitate strong mortgage finance institutions, building societies and cooperatives, and refinance institutions.      
High interest rates discourage borrowing for housing. Apart from revamping the macroeconomic environment to crash interest and foreign exchange rates and tame inflation, President Bola Tinubu’s administration should partner with domestic and foreign lenders to channel low interest credit to the housing sector.
Escalating inflation makes housing materials very expensive. Cement, a major material, currently sells above N5,000 per bag despite the country being almost self-sufficient in its production. Consequently, many housing projects are currently suspended.
The National Housing Fund, established in 1992 by the Federal Government to provide a pool of cheap funds for housing development and acquisition, has not worked due to several factors, chief among which is the failure of the government to contribute to the pool as specified by the law. The law also mandates contributions from workers, banks, and investments by insurance companies, but is obeyed in the breach.
The government should live up to its responsibility by revitalising and upgrading the Act and the NHF. Each state government should consistently implement mass housing programmes with strong private sector partnership. All the tiers of government should take realistic steps to bridge the country’s grave housing shortfall.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13155925/Zulum-5.jpg

President Bola Tinubu, while responding to the programme proposed by the National Livestock Reform Committee, said the Federal Government would “cover the cost of acquiring the land” for cattle rearing. He believes this will create jobs for veterinary doctors, bring up medical facilities for herders, make the livestock industry viable for private sector participation, and help establish new educational opportunities for herders and their children.
This looks good on the surface. The imperative of stopping the prevailing open grazing of cattle and its attendant problems, and adopting ranching, the acceptable, modern and economically profitable mode, is manifesting daily. Tinubu should rally all stakeholders towards achieving that objective. He should not accede to the retrogressive preference of some influential groups that supported his presidential bid for a continuation of the primitive open grazing farming.
Livestock farming is a business; it should be separated from politics. The government estimates Nigeria’s livestock potential at N33 trillion annually if properly harnessed. Currently contributing 17 per cent of the country’s agricultural GDP and 5.0 per cent of national GDP, its 20.7 million head of cattle is Africa’s sixth largest, according to The Mail of London, quoting diverse authorities. The industry generates 36.5 per cent of Nigerians’ total protein intake, says the Federal Ministry of Agriculture.
But the sector is under-performing largely because it is driven by the centuries-old open grazing. This leads to lower meat and milk yields, lack of job opportunities, and conflict. 
Nigeria’s livestock management must be guided by clarity; the government must take into cognisance the legitimate concerns of herders, farmers, and other stakeholders. Currently, illegal and brutal Fulani encroachments and criminality have carved a bloody trail across the country and contributed greatly to insecurity and terrorism in the country.
Genocidal killings are ongoing in Southern Kaduna, Benue, Nasarawa, Taraba, and Adamawa states perpetrated by herders and Fulani militia. Farmers in Oyo, Ondo, Osun and Ogun, Kwara, Kogi, Enugu, Ebonyi, Edo, and Cross River and Delta states, have also borne the brunt. The Global Terrorism Index designates the Fulani herders/militia the world’s fourth deadliest terrorist group.  Related News   Tinubu appoints new RECs for Lagos, Rivers,  seven others  S’Court rules on Atiku, Obi’s appeals against Tinubu Thursday  JUST IN: Tinubu names Mustapha CEO, Energy Commission of Nigeria   
Chaired by Abdullahi Ganduje, ex-governor of Kano State, the NLRC claims that the reform will help deescalate insecurity, but it glosses over the atrocities of the herders, and their untenable claim of entitlement to graze their cattle on other people’s land. The committee was also silent on the partisanship of the Federal Government and its security agencies for the Fulani.      
This reached reprehensible heights under Muhammadu Buhari. Tinubu should change the story. Everyone benefits, especially the cattle owners, when ranching is adopted. All the tricks adopted in the Buhari era – cattle colonies, RUGA, water bill, and others – to confer undue advantage on herders should be dropped.
A Northern elite initiative led by Ganduje, now the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, the NLRC admits that livestock is a business and implies that open grazing is unsustainable. States with ample land and livestock populations should roll out policies to attract private foreign and local investment in ranching, and meat processing.
The NLRC’s 2023 report spotlights how Nigeria is lagging. It has the largest number of ruminant animals at 156.31 million, with 7.6 per cent of its population being pastoralist.
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the United States have thriving livestock industries with huge private investments. They also have strong local and international demand and favourable business environment. Brazil’s government has consistently supported livestock farmers by encouraging ranching, investing in research, providing access to low interest credit programmes, and encouraging international best practices and technology deployment.
To tap the immense potential and end the endless conflict over grazing land, this administration should drive a national ranching programme driven by private investment.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/11101001/Bola-Tinubu2.jpg

Apart from shaping the future of generations, they serve as role models for the youth. Beyond speeches, President Bola Tinubu and his education ministers, and the state governments should undertake a critical review of Nigeria’s education system, including how the Nigerian teacher has fared, as a prelude to sweeping reforms.
This year’s theme, “The Teachers We Need for the Education We Want: The Global Imperative to Reverse Teacher Shortage,” speaks to a major gap in Nigeria’s education sector; the shortage of qualified teachers and should serve as another wake-up call.
October 5 every year is set aside, explained UNESCO, to celebrate the resilience of teachers all around the world. It commemorates the anniversary of the adoption of the 1996 ILO/UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers, which sets benchmarks regarding the rights and responsibilities of teachers, and standards for their initial preparation and further education, recruitment, employment, teaching and learning conditions.
Being a teacher, according to UNESCO, provides the unique opportunity to make a transformative and lasting impact on the lives of others, contributing to shaping sustainable futures and offering personal fulfilment. 
However, the world faces an unprecedented global teacher shortage exacerbated by a decline in their working conditions and status, said the UN.
Nigeria’s case is troubling. There are not enough teachers for the teeming student population. One reason cited is the poor welfare of teachers in the country, which has driven very bright minds away from the profession into more lucrative vocations.
According to the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria, the country has only 2.3 million registered teachers on its database as of 2023. This is barely enough to cater to the over 20.1 million out-of-school children (per UNESCO).      
There are multiple challenges. UNICEF noted that in the North-East, the teacher-to-student ratio is 1:124. Little wonder the region hosts the highest population of out-of-school children.  Related News   Oyebanji receives national best teacher award winner  Obaseki to extend teachers' retirement age to 65  Oyo, Anambra teachers win presidential prizes   
Nigerian teachers are reckoned to be poorly paid. Many in the private schools do not even earn the country’s minimum wage of N30,000 monthly. Classes are sometimes over-populated, and teachers are not provided public address devices.
Teachers in Togo can earn as much as $111 monthly, according to official figures. This is higher than the country’s minimum wage of $64 per month.
Today’s world is knowledge-driven. Competing requires acquisition of cutting-edge skills and information. Constantly, there should be better welfare package for the teachers.
The National Union of Teachers complains that teachers leaving the service in many states were not being replaced, while the quality of teaching is fast declining. The NUT’s calls for urgent and creative action by the state governments to accord priority to the education should resonate with the governors.
The Universal Basic Education Commission said there were 354,651 teachers for 7.2 million students in pre-primary schools; 915,593 teachers for 32 million students in primary schools; and 416,291 teachers for eight million students in junior secondary schools.
Over the years, the federal and various state governments have tried to address the problems; but the policies have proved to be inadequate. More should be done.        
Recently, Nigeria saw a mass migration of teachers when the United Kingdom commenced a teacher’s recruitment, which will prioritise applicants from Nigeria and other developing countries. They will be paid thousands of pounds to teach 11-16 year-old children mathematics, languages and science.
To improve quality and avoid losing more competent ones, therefore, Nigeria’s governments should improve their training, welfare, and career progression.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/03145016/teachers-e1475502742794.jpg

Though advanced in age then and confined to his bed, he was always meticulous in offering his blessings.
Like other elders of his time, there were special prayers he was always rendering in Yoruba for travellers. One of such prayers is E ko ni rin ni ojo ti ebi npa ona. The literal meaning is that one will not travel on a day when the roads are famished. I think the belief behind this was that there are days when roads are hungry for human blood or flesh.
It can also be deduced from the prayer that there are days the roads are not famished at all, therefore accidents are not recorded on those days. This of course will be difficult to prove. But it may also be deduced that not all traffic crashes get to the notice of these prayer warriors.
Another related prayer point back in the day was that A ko ni fi eje yin pa titi laro o. Again, the literal meaning is that may one’s blood not be used to tar the road. As far as those behind this prayer are concerned, once there is bloodshed at an accident scene, the victims’ blood has been used to tar the road. I can hear those we call spirit koko shouting God forbid! 
I decided to veer into the issue of road crashes and the carnages on our roads this week because of the rate of accidents and their frequencies. It is alarming.
On October 8, 2023, the Federal Road Safety Corps, established in 1988 and saddled with the responsibilities of regulating, enforcing and coordinating all road traffic and safety management activities, released what looked like scary figures on road crashes in the country in the first nine months of 2023.
According to the data released by the Corps Public Education Officer, Assistant Corps Marshal Bisi Kazeem, no fewer than 3,730 Nigerians lost their lives in various road accidents across the country between January and September 2023! Kazeem also put the number of crashes across the country during the same period at 7,830.      
As huge and heart-rending as the figures are, FRSC said the figures recorded during the same period in 2022 were higher. This probably means there are still reasons to celebrate, or what do you do when figures are reducing? On the number of deaths recorded, the corps said this year’s figure is a 23.1 per cent reduction from the 4,848 fatalities recorded in the same period in 2022.
Kazeem said that in the number of people killed, the corps also recorded a significant reduction within the operational period. “According to the crash data report, in the first nine months of 2023, the corps recorded a total of 3,730 fatalities as against 4,848 in the same period in 2022, representing a 23.1 per cent reduction,” he said.
In the same vein, Kazeem said the corps achieved a 22 per cent reduction in crashes and a 21.3 per cent decrease in road injuries when compared with the same period in 2022.
He added, “The corps recorded a total of 7,830 road traffic crashes as against 10,039 in the same period in 2022, representing a 22 per cent decrease.

“From January to September 2023, the corps also achieved a 21.3 per cent reduction in the number of people rescued with injuries. The corps rescued a total of 22,580 in 2023 against 28,698 injured victims from January to September of 2022.”
Kazeem attributed what he described as “the significant decrease” to enhanced visibility on the highways, aggressive public education, broadened and expanded command structures, as well as injection of more patrol, rescue and recovery vehicles into the operations of the corps.
There is nothing wrong if the FRSC decides to praise itself. As the late Chinua Achebe put it, the lizard that jumped from the high Iroko tree to the ground said he would praise himself if no one else did.        
The truth of the matter is, however, that data or no data, the reality on our roads is not something to roll out the drums for. From the North to the South and the East to the West, one gets inundated daily with news of crashes and deaths on the nation’s major highways.
In Lagos State, for instance, the state police command, the FRSC, the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority and other emergency responders are always busy issuing alerts and statements on accidents every time. One minute, a truck is crashing into cars on one road, the other minute, a fuel-laden tanker is falling and exploding on another road. These are apart from lone accidents where drivers either ram into bridges or road dividers.
The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is not an exception. I am not sure if a day can pass without a major accident recorded on that stretch of road. Last week Wednesday, a fuel-laden tanker fell around 11pm at the Olowotedo Bus Stop end of the road, the resultant fire engulfed about three trucks apart from the tanker. The carcasses of the affected vehicles are still on the road setbacks.
On Sunday, five persons lost their lives in a separate incident around the Kara Bridge end of the same road with many others injured in a crash that involved a truck, a commercial bus and a Sports Utility Vehicle.
Up North, there was a time earlier in the year that there was no day that there would be no report of major road accidents from Bauchi State. So frequent were the cases that my editor once called for a special feature detailing such accidents, the roads where cases of accidents are more pronounced in the state, possible causes and the way out.
With the end of the year fast approaching and the numerous travels that usually characterise the period, there are fears that cases of road crashes will increase. I can only advise that men of the FRSC and others should intensify efforts aimed at ensuring that crashes are reduced to the minimum. They should ensure that only roadworthy vehicles ply our roads. They should move against drivers who specialise in violating speed limits, driving against traffic and overloading among other major causes of road crashes.
On the part of the government, if our vehicles are roadworthy, we will not be asking for too much if we demand that our roads too must be “vehicle worthy.” Simply put, this means all major roads begging for attention across the country should be given the deserved attention.

Of course, it will involve the Minister of Finance and other ministers that are relevant to the process. This is a flexible form of financing that is supposed to help Nigeria adequately respond to a humanitarian crisis. This will also respond to challenges as well as adequately address the issue of poverty in Nigeria and bring victory for the poor and indeed, bring help and succour which the Renewed Hope Agenda stands for”
–Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Dr Betta Edu, while addressing State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council Meeting on Monday, October 23, 2023
According to the World Bank, “Social protection systems are at the heart of boosting human capital and empowering people. They help individuals and families, especially the poor and vulnerable, cope with crises and shocks, find jobs, improve productivity, invest in the health and education of their children, and protect the aging population. Social protection systems that are well-designed can have powerful impacts in the long-term, by reducing inequalities, building resilience and ending the inter-generational cycle of poverty. Such systems and tools are transformative as they help mitigate economic and fiscal shocks and provide opportunity by giving people a chance to get out of poverty and become productive members of society.” As of March 2023, the World Bank is providing $26bn in financing through its social protection and jobs programmes across regions and income levels.
Perhaps, it is the Bretton Wood institution called the World Bank that sold the idea of NSIP to former President Muhammadu Buhari. Indeed, it is the ex-president’s signature programme for which he will be remembered for life. The NSIP was established in 2016 as a social safety net to care for the poor and needy. The seed fund then was N500bn. It was the biggest welfarist programme in Africa at inception. According to the information gleaned from the website of the agency, “The suite of programmes under the NSIP focuses on ensuring a more equitable distribution of resources to vulnerable populations, including children, youth and women. Since 2016, these programmes combined have supported more than four million beneficiaries’ countrywide through a fair and transparent process supported by the Ministry of Budget and National Planning and other notable MDAs with aligned goals.” 
The programmes under the NSIP are fourfold. The N-Power programme is designed to assist young Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 35 to acquire and develop lifelong skills for becoming change makers in their communities and players in the domestic and global markets and given a stipend of N30,000 monthly. There are four sectors in N-Power namely; education, agriculture, health and vocational training. The Conditional Cash Transfer programme directly supports those within the lowest poverty bracket by improving nutrition, increasing household consumption and supporting the development of human capital through cash benefits to various categories of the poor and vulnerable. The support is conditioned on fulfilling soft and hard co-responsibilities that enable recipients to improve their standard of living.
Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme is a micro-lending intervention that targets traders, artisans, enterprising youth, farmers and women in particular, by providing loans between N10,000 and N100,000 at no monthly cost to beneficiaries. The home-grown school feeding programme is reducing the incidence of malnutrition (especially among the poor and those ordinarily unable to eat a meal a day), empowering community women as cooks, and supporting small farmers that help economic growth stimulation.
There is no gainsaying that the motive behind the establishment of the NSIP is noble and laudable. However, the implementation has been enmeshed in swirling controversies and corrupt practices. This newspaper in its May 26, 2019 edition reported that, “President Muhammadu Buhari’s wife, Aisha, has rubbished the N500bn Social Investment Programme of her husband’s administration, saying that it has failed ‘woefully,’ especially in the North. Aisha, who hails from Adamawa State, said the situation in her home state, as far as the SIP implementation was concerned, was pathetic. She also cited Kano, a highly-populated northern state, as another example where she believed the programme had failed, despite the huge funds the Federal Government had budgeted for it.”        Related News   Renewed hope agenda creating productive opportunities for youths – Minister  FG suspends N-Power, probes disbursement of funds  Iyaloja Fund: FG commits N75bn loan to 1.5m market women   
The Guardian in its July 12, 2020 edition reported that, “Since its inception, the scheme has had the misfortune of attracting controversies, with the latest being the newly introduced Modified Home Grown School Feeding Programme, which got many to conclude that feeding schoolchildren to improve their health and to spur school enrolment were far from being the major objectives of the initiative. Despite protestations from Nigerians, the Minister of MHADMSD, Hajia Sadiya Farouq, went ahead with the strange feeding programme claiming that the Presidency directed her ministry to carry out the exercise even when schools are closed. According to her, she was mandated to deliver feeding support to 3.5 million homes, as against pupils.”
The Guardian reported further that, “The leadership of the National Assembly is not just irked by the way and manner that the NSIPs are being implemented; it is even displeased with the current national social register being used, which it claims was contrived by ‘the World Bank method,’ hence the compelling need for it to be immediately discarded. The Senate President Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, when they met with Minister Farouq, and some top officials of the ministry in April, lamented that the funds have failed to reach those for whom the initiative was created.” Recently, on July 20, 2023, the National Economic Council unanimously resolved to do away with the national social register used by the Buhari administration to implement its conditional cash transfer, saying it lacks credibility. Consequently, it asked states to generate their own registers for such cash transfers. This is the same register that has been used for seven years!
On Saturday, October 7, 2023, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Dr. Betta Edu, announced the indefinite suspension of the N-Power programme during a live interview on TVC News. Edu said the programme had been marred by irregularities, adding that the government had launched an investigation into the utilisation of funds since the inception of the scheme. She added that some of the beneficiaries of the programme were not found in their places of assignment, yet they were receiving monthly stipends. She also stated that some of the N-Power beneficiaries ought to have exited the programme in 2022, but were still on the payroll.
On October 1, 2023, President Bola Tinubu announced that 15 million households would receive N25,000 for three months.  Last week, precisely on October 17, 2023, the President, represented by the Secretary to the Federal Government, Senator George Akume, launched the Renewed Hope Conditional Cash Transfer for 15 million households. The launch was held at the Press Gallery of the State House in Abuja coinciding with the World Poverty Eradication Day. On top of this is the FEC approval of the establishment of the $5bn Humanitarian and Poverty Alleviation Trust Fund.
What is the transparency and accountability framework as well as the monitoring and evaluation template put in place to ensure that this huge investment is not misappropriated? Has the fraudulent social register been cleaned up to allow for the disbursement of this huge fund under the CCT? How does the Federal Government want to recover loans disbursed under the GEEP programme from defaulters? How do we bring culprits who have embezzled the NSIP funds to book? Can Nigerians trust Dr. Betta Edu to do better than her predecessor?

columns,Knotty areas in the use of apostrophes,"A few days ago, I got a question from a member of this class.

She wants to know which is correctly punctuated between the following:
    I saw John’s and David’s house.
    I saw John and David’s house.
As you can see, in the first clause only David carries an apostrophe. In the second, both John and David do. The fellow thus wants to know which is correct. 
The question brings to mind how tricky it is to apply the apostrophe in some situations. It is a punctuation mark we use to indicate possession, omission of elements in contractions while it is also useful in pluralising letters, figures and symbols. The question (we are treating) is about how the apostrophe shows possession:
    I saw the boy’s pen. (Whose pen?)
    Chief Denge’s car is red. (Whose car?)      
    Is this Jones’/ key?
    I saw the boys’ pens. (Plural)
    The men’s jerseys have been taken away. (A plural that does not end with ‘s’.)
But because two people are involved in the question, the application becomes challenging. The rule, however, is when you need to show possession of the nouns in a group you should know whether or not they (the nouns) jointly own the object involved. When there is joint possession, you add ’s to the last noun in the group:
    I once worked in Mr Ade and Biodun’s company.
    She is the one who painted Justin and Kelvin’s car.
In each situation, the apostrophe is attached to the last noun because the object (company/car) belongs to the duo. But this is not the case in:        
    I once worked in Mr Ade’s and Biodun’s companies.
    She is the one who painted Justin’s and Kelvin’s cars.
In both, there is no joint possession of the objects. Mr Ade has his own company; Biodun has his and the speaker worked in both. It would, therefore, be wrong to add the apostrophe to only one of the nouns. In other words, ‘I saw John and David’s house’ is the appropriate construction because there is an indication that the facility is jointly owned by both guys. For ‘I saw John’s and David’s house’ to be correct, we need to have at least two houses:
    I saw John and David’s house. (Correct. Jointly owned.)
    I saw John’s and David’s houses. (Correct. Two houses, each owned by a different person.)  Related News   
Contractions
You should always be careful when punctuating contractions too. Even in social media posts, don’t rob your sentences of apostrophes. Why do you flirt with dont, isnt etc. in your posts? Very importantly too, remember that the contracted form of ‘I am’ is I’m, not ‘am’ while there is a huge difference between its and it’s as well as his and he’s:      
    I am 23 years old. (Correct)
    Am 23 years old. (Wrong)
     i’ am 23 years old. (Wrong)
    I’m 23 years old. (Correct)
    It is raining. (Correct)
    Its raining. (Wrong)
    It’s raining. (Correct)  
    This is it’s handle. (Wrong)
    This is its handle. (Correct)
    He is waiting for you. (Correct)
    His waiting for you. (Wrong)
    He’s waiting for you. (Correct)
Lastly, study how apostrophes are used with letters, numbers and symbols here:
     Angel got five A’s and four B’s in WASSCE.      
     There are four 4’s in 16.
     The editor complained that Taju is fond of using &’s in his articles.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/25182115/Akeem-Lasisi.jpg

Both of them became the premier and deputy premier respectively of the Province of Manitoba.
Canada uses the name “premier” for the chief executives of its federating units like Nigeria did in the First Republic when it had regions run by premiers. Today while Canada still calls its federating units provinces, in 1979 Nigeria adopted the American example of calling its federating units “states” and calling the heads of those units “governors.”
The 41-year-old Kinew, a broadcaster and a rapper with two albums, was inaugurated as the 25th premier of Manitoba. He appointed 39-year-old Asagwara, a psychiatric nurse and retired basketballer, his deputy as well as the health minister for the province.
Canada practises a parliamentary system of government in which only elected parliamentarians can hold political positions. Therefore, to qualify to become the deputy premier, Asagwara was re-elected as a member of parliament of Manitoba’s Legislative Assembly on October 3, after joining two others to make history in 2019 as the first set of three Blacks to ever get elected into the Manitoba Legislature in the 150-year history of the province. 
But Asagwara is not the first person of Nigerian descent that has held the post of deputy premier in Canada. That record belongs to Kelechi “Kaycee” Madu, who was the deputy premier of Alberta from October 2022 to June 2023. While Asagwara was born in Canada, Madu was born in southeastern Nigeria, grew up in Nigeria, studied in Nigeria and only relocated to Canada in 2005 when his wife went for further studies. However, 14 years after getting to Canada, he had already won an election into the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, becoming the first Nigerian-Canadian to achieve that feat. That same month of April in 2019, the premier appointed him Minister of Municipal Affairs for the province, which was also the first for a Nigerian-Canadian. In August 2020, Madu made history for Nigeria again when he was appointed the first Black minister of justice and solicitor-general for a province in Canada. In February 2022, he was made the Minister of Labour and Immigration. Then in October 2022, he was made the Deputy Premier and Minister of Skilled Trades and Professions.
However, the increasing embrace of multiculturalism and diversity in the political leadership of Canada is not only extended to Nigerian-Canadians. Canada is not only opening its borders to people from all parts of the world; it is earnestly preaching and promoting inclusiveness in all spheres and fighting against all the vestiges of discrimination in all shapes and forms. The message is sinking deeper into the citizens, leading to people being elected based on their competence and character rather than their race, age, gender, and the like.
For example, in the first week of this October, Liberal MP Greg Fergus made history by becoming Canada’s first Black Speaker of the House of Commons. His grandfather had immigrated to Canada from Montserrat, a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean. Similarly, in October last year, Ken Sim made history as the first Chinese-Canadian to become the mayor of a Canadian city when he beat incumbent Kennedy Stewart to become the mayor of Vancouver in British Columbia. Also in June this year, Olivia Chow made history as she became the first Chinese-Canadian woman to be elected mayor of a Canadian city when she emerged the mayor of Toronto, Canada’s biggest city.

Among the top four parties of Canada, one of them is led by an Indian-Canadian. Jagmeet Singh, who is a turban-wearing Sikh, has been the leader of the New Democratic Party since 2017. Following his election, Singh emerged the first non-White Canadian to lead a major Canadian federal political party on a permanent basis. In March 2022, the NDP signed a “supply-and-confidence” agreement with the ruling Liberal Party, which entails that the NDP will align its votes with the government on vote of confidence and budgetary issues like budget implementation legislation and money bills. This voting commitment subsists until the tenure of the current parliament ends in 2025, during which time the Liberals will have presented four federal budgets.
In 2022, for the first time in the history of Canada, the country’s population grew by over one million people. International migration accounted for 95.9 per cent of that growth. While 437,180 were permanent residents, 607,782 were non-permanent residents.
Economic immigration programmes – comprising worker programmes, business programmes, the Provincial Nominee Programme and temporary resident to permanent resident programmes – contributed 58.5 per cent of all new Canadian permanent residents in 2022. Nigeria was among the top four countries that contributed to the source of these economic migrants. 118,095 immigrants came from India (27 per cent); 31,815 from China (7.2 per cent); 23,735 from Afghanistan (5.4 per cent); and 22,085 from Nigeria (5.05 per cent). The Philippines accounted for 22,070 immigrants (5.04 per cent), while France accounted for 14,145 immigrants (3.2 per cent). The other countries on the top ten were Pakistan (11,585), Iran (11,105), United States (10,400), and Syria (8,500).
Unlike in the distant past when Canada was more of a transit country for Nigerians seeking entry into the US, the tide has turned. Circumstances have made many people place Canada high on their list of preferred countries. These days, some people even use the US as their transit country into Canada. And unlike in the past when migrants were more inclined to move to Canadian big cities like Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver, the tide has also turned. According to figures from Statistics Canada, the country’s bureau in charge of statistics, the two fastest-growing cities in Canada in 2022 were Moncton and Halifax, all in the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Nigerians have a large community in these cities and other cities, and most of them are professionals from various fields who left Nigeria mainly because of insecurity.
The inroads made by some Nigerians into the Canadian political sphere should serve as a source of inspiration to these Nigerians who have relocated and others who will join them in the months ahead. It is true that every Nigerian professional who relocates to another country would be more concerned about career success, yet while pursuing the proverbial golden fleece, these Nigerian-Canadians should endeavour to participate in the politics of their community. Being politically aloof should not be an option, because those in politics take the decisions that affect everybody.
Luckily, unlike in Nigeria where most professionals shy away from politics because of the dirt and violence involved, the terrain is different in Western democracies. Politics in Western democracies is not a financial investment. It is service. One does not need the endorsement of any godfather or moneybags to excel in politics in Canada. One only needs interest, character, ideas and resilience.
While efforts are still on to turn around the politics in Nigeria and reclaim it from those who have vowed that Nigeria will not know progress, Nigerians abroad should get involved in the politics of their countries of residence. Who knows? They may be the agents of change that will facilitate the rescue of Nigeria from the political overlords that have held Nigeria down for decades.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04061907/Azuka.jpg

The...,"<span class=""post-date"">23rd October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/appraising-recent-economic-policies/,  Sheriffdeen Tella,"President Bola Tinubu government was inaugurated on the verge of total collapse of the Nigerian economy. The economy was on a stretcher in the Intensive Care Unit being discharged in a wheelchair. The economy was suffering from debt trap, poverty trap and the haemorrhage of spending all earnings on debts repayment. The prescription from the International Monetary Fund to the old government, as reported in the news, was reduction in debts, removal of oil subsidy and the harmonisation of exchange rate. That government did not do it and the same prescription was probably offered to the new government behind the scenes or just adopted by it. So, when the President was sworn in, he announced the removal of fuel subsidy and a few days later, the merging of the various exchange rates stands. Clearly there was no planned response to what could happen.
Although the Muhammadu Buhari administration did not remove the fuel subsidy, it had already prepared for the removal by providing subsidy for only the first half of the year and arranging $800m loan from the World Bank. It was all well laid out by the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and IMF) which would normally warn you professionally but would also set a trap for your fall. Both institutions have warned us at different times of the seriousness of our debt trap and debt burden which make it imperative for us to spend over 80 per cent of our revenue on debt servicing, leaving nothing for growth and development. Yet, they provide you with concessional loans when they are sure nobody wants to offer the same loans. This country has continued to live on borrowed funds from the international debt market or the Central Bank of Nigeria since post-COVID. Once an economy is destroyed by economic mismanagement, political turmoil and social insecurity take over. Where is the Nigerian economy now? The economy is on its way back to the ICU with multiple sclerosis. The signs are obvious, the routes are laid with thorns but the economic managers are being goaded to ride on.
Recently and actually, within the last four weeks, the Debt Management Office raised the regular Federal Government monthly bond and N150bn, 10-year Sukuk bond. Both bonds are worth almost N300bn to mobilise domestic debts to meet some developmental needs, including road maintenance and construction in six geo-political zones of the nation. The loans, as usual, were oversubscribed. This implies that there are lots of idle funds domestically looking for borrowers. When it came to borrowing for domestic consumption, (or what is cash transfer meant for?) the World Bank offered foreign loans and we grabbed it! What is the economic rationale for the decision? Why would you borrow foreign money to consume domestic or even foreign goods? What is the monthly FG bond meant for? Can’t it be used for conditional cash transfer if it is necessary and not meant to enrich some people? What was the outcome of the conditional cash transfer programme under the Buhari or Goodluck Jonathan administrations? If successful, we should not be talking of over 60 per cent of Nigerians in the poverty trap today. We are treading in another blind alleyway unless we stop these foreign loans for consumption purposes.
Within the context of advocacy of free trade and the obedience to the World Bank and IMF doctrine of free trade, the CBN, last week, lifted ban on the 43 items disallowed from official forex support in 2015. The CBN released document which stated, among others, “Importers of all the 43 items previously restricted by the 2015 circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/010, and its addendums are now allowed to purchase foreign exchange in the Nigerian foreign exchange market.” 
Some of the rationale for imposing the ban included official shortage of forex and the need to manage what we had for important imports; the need to protect local industries from competition with foreign products in an unequal competitive environment, and to prevent dumping for foreign goods that might even be inferior to local products. Have situations or environment changed to warrant lifting the ban?
Let us note that the CBN did not ban those products from coming into the country but getting foreign exchange from official sources. The foreign exchange situation is in a more precarious situation today than before and one would think that more products would have been added to the 43 other than lifting the ban. On the issue of protecting infant industries, I really do not agree that local industries remain infants for life. The assumption has always been that the protection would make the local industries grow and expand through the application of research and development to production processes. The industries could even be able to develop the use of local raw materials, a kind of backward bending into agriculture or primary sectors, thereby promoting employment in that sector, which is the true nature of industrialisation. Our entrepreneurs are not wired to think that way. Exploitation or profit maximisation is their watchword.  Related News   Tinubu seeks Senate's confirmation of ICPC chairman, others  JUST IN: Tinubu approves N18bn assurance policy for fallen heroes' families  Tinubu, prosecute Bawa or release him   
Presently, our industrialists have a different mentality. How many local manufacturing outfits have research and development units, or link up with relevant faculties in tertiary institutions as do foreign manufacturers? How many of them are creative and promote industrial growth? If we check the state of the growth of the industries over the period of the ban, we could see that they remained where they were, producing on a small scale to create scarcity and be able to maximise profits. They seem not to realise that the larger the quantity produced the lower the unit cost and lower the price of the commodities which invariably make the products available and affordable to the consumers. They are more interested in getting foreign exchange through over-invoicing of imports rather than growing through backward and forward linkages with agriculture and subsidiary companies to become competitive. No doubt, the production environment from the government side may be difficult for production but few businesses that are creative are surviving through sincerity of purpose.      
On the issue of dumping foreign goods in Nigeria, the ban on those 43 items did not prevent that activity. Nigerians’ tastes for foreign goods encourage dumping. Reports show that despite the banning of those 43 items from getting forex at the official rate, the goods still found their way into the country in large quantities. We have to change our taste; we have to promote the use and consumption of local products through good quality products, availability, affordability and advertisements or product promotion. What is important for the CBN to note is that lifting the ban on the 43 products will put much pressure on the demand for forex and worsen the already precarious exchange rate situation and cost of production. The emerging situation or post-ban situation has to be monitored and if there is the need for reversal, the CBN should not regard such action as a failure.
The IMF again proposed the need for the economic management team to collect more taxes and raise interest rates as supporting policies for the subsidy removal. The interpretation of these twin policies is important. To collect more taxes should mean that the tax net be widened to cover those industries and businesses missed by the tax net presently rather than increasing tax paid by individuals and businesses. Providing water, electricity and other basic needs by households and businesses are partly taxes and in addition to the direct taxes being paid. The tax authorities should be more effective and efficient in tax collection as well as in the usage of the fund. For now, we do not see the benefits of the taxes paid.
Interest rates are costs on borrowing, and increases cost of fund for production. The current high rate of interest arising from shortage of fund and the resultant high cost of production is making African products less competitive against foreign goods. So, what does the IMF mean by charging higher interest rates? Lending interest rates in developed economies hardly reach eight per cent while it starts from 15 per cent in Africa, except South Africa.
At the United Nations General Assembly 78 in New York in September 2023, African nations were asked to look inward for solutions to their problems. They were advised to trade more among themselves. Will they? Africa, including Nigeria, has been captured by foreign ideas, foreign goods, foreign loan mentality.

They are reflected in laws, norms, and policies that guide a nation and its people. To a great extent, the larger section of humanity recognises certain fundamental values which have been enacted that drive human conduct in the desired direction for peace, progress and the continuation of the human race.This discourse reviews the Nigerian value system as epitomised by the value system of its political elite which is supported by a vast number of the population.
The first issue to note is that values are not necessarily on the same wavelength with legalism and the prophecies of what courts will do in any given case. The moral code that states that “you shall not kill” which is the foundation for the crime of murder and prescribes a sentence for murder is not the same as trial in a court of law where a guilty man can escape justice due to human failings. Values are reflected in human character and conduct. Character in leadership is very vital and it is the foundation of everything else in leadership. Character is the very essence of the human person. They are the mental and moral qualities distinctive to an individual, the personality, nature, disposition, temperament, mentality, psyche, psychology, constitution, make-up of an individual. This is what makes an individual, a leader, what he is; how he will make policy, execute policy and react to the society he leads.
Beyond physical capital made up of land, natural resources such as oil, lithium, equipment and machinery, etc., human capital, I dare say, is the most important capital needed to drive development and progress. Human capital includes the qualifications, skills and competencies of the population. A distinctive part of this human capital is its values reflected in the character of the people and the way things are done. They reflect in the work ethics; manifestation of virtues like honesty, patience and hard work; the solemnity to sit down and think through challenges to create innovation and products that drive change and solve social problems. It is about whether citizens are ready to put in a full day’s work for a full day’s pay or work for half a day and claim a full day, consideration for others, readiness to pay tax, etc.  These values drive the intangibles such as the rule of law, distinguishing between law in the books and law in the day-to-day lives of people.
In Nigeria of today, we have vast arable land, mineral resources like oil in abundance and a rich reservoir of trained personnel in many sectors. But it appears that the majority of the population or the leadership lacks these essential values necessary for economic growth, peace and progress. We steal public resources, disobey traffic rules, avoid and refuse to pay tax, pervert justice when appointed as judges, rig elections and deploy thugs to harm people. Yet we expect our economy to grow. Pray, is it not the human element that has prevented the nation’s four refineries from producing refined petroleum products? Why do Nigerians, always frustrated at home, excel in different endeavours in foreign lands? Nigeria’s currency is under intense pressure leading it to depreciate in value, at the official window from  N450 to N770 and at the parallel market from N750 to N1,100 in a space of less than six months, yet the elected representatives of the people must drive foreign-made SUVs that cost about N150m each. What is the value system of such inconsiderate legislators who do not care if the nation were to capsize only if they satisfy their craze for fancy cars? It is all about values.  Related News   
A human being should understand and anticipate the natural consequences of his act. When you vote and support a dishonest fellow into a position of power because he is your tribesman or from your religion, you have started the first act of the law of sowing and reaping. When a person comes on radio or television to analyse a burning national issue and his opening remarks state he is not here to discuss morals, he is simply stating that there are no values attached to his analysis, anything goes and there are no fundamentals. Thus, a leader who is dishonest will make dishonesty an instrument of state policy; a compassionate person brings the quality into his leadership, etc. Character is very vital to leadership; it holds the key to the gravamen of leadership. Character is not developed overnight. It is developed over time and cannot also be changed all of a sudden except there are very harsh life lessons or the leader imbibes distinctive lessons in discipline overnight.The need for good character informs constitutional provisions on disqualification of a person for the high office of President or governor which includes that within a period of less than 10 years before the election, he has been convicted and sentenced of an offence involving dishonesty, he has been found guilty of contravening the code of conduct for public officers or he has presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission. Furthermore, all Nigerian leaders swear to an oath to abide by the constitutional code of conduct which is the same as swearing to be of good character and conduct in the discharge of official duties.
It has been stated that the measure of a man’s real character is what he would do if he knew he would never be found out. What would a leader who preaches the sermon of good character do if no one is watching? What does he spend his security vote on since he is not held strictly accountable for the expenditure? Answers to these questions will show the character of a leader and the nobility of his intentions. Leadership in Nigeria is supposed to be primarily focused on the security and welfare of the people, not of the rich or any section of Nigerians, but of the whole Nigeria. Leadership’s reaction to the vulnerable, the deprived shows its quality and ability to carry all segments of society along in policy formulation and implementation. Hence, the challenge of inclusivity, tackling inequality and guaranteeing life in larger freedom for all segments of society.
In the final analysis, in this society without values, where anything goes and the end justifies the means, we are all losers. We are all profiled in foreign airports as drug pushers; we are treated as scammers, liars, certificate forgers, etc. At home, we are victims of insecurity, inflation, electricity deficit and poor governance. For those who think they have stolen their way out of what affects fellow citizens, the day of reckoning will soon come.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14224316/Eze-Onyekpere.jpg

It is also known as acrochordons and may affect as much as 60 per cent of the population. ...,"<span class=""post-date"">22nd October 2023</span>",https://punchng.com/dealing-with-skin-tags/,  Dr. Sylvester Ikhisemojie,"A skin tag is a soft piece of tiny skin tissue that may have a stalk. That stalk is also known as a peduncle. It is also known as acrochordons and may affect as much as 60 per cent of the population. The blood supply to the tag often flows through that peduncle. A skin tag thus has a variety of names some of which are descriptive. Some people refer to it as a cutaneous papilloma, while others call it a cutaneous tag. Others call it a soft fibroma, while, yet others call it fibroma molluscum. We shall stop there because there are yet other names, which probably have no relevance to the understanding of the layman.
Skin tags are generally very common and often occur after midlife. Both men and women are equally affected. These growths commonly occur in the creases or folds of the skin and are, therefore, found mainly around the neck and the face. They are not considered dangerous but many of the people who have them usually express the wish to have them removed for both cosmetic and aesthetic reasons. There are various methods of removal of these growths, and we shall be looking at some of these methods later in this discussion.
Besides, they are recognised as benign growths, which are certainly not cancerous but are nonetheless described as skin tumours. They often consist of a core of ducts, nerve cells and fat cells, and have a covering made up of skin. They are also rich in blood supply for which reason they usually bleed in the course of removal or when they are injured.
These growths are often found on the eyelids, under the breasts, armpits, the neck as we said before, the upper chest and the groin. Some people have these growths and somehow never notice them. Some of these may rub off and fall away on their own, especially in the course of scrubbing the skin with a sponge while taking a bath. Others may drop off when rubbed by jewellery, while shaving or by clothes. They usually have a smooth surface but sometimes, the surfaces are also irregular. At all times, they are raised above the surface of the skin. They are held in their various positions by a peduncle, and they often retain the colour of the surrounding skin but may actually be much darker at some other times. 
It is these dark ones that frequently stand out and become noticeable. They usually start as really small growths, sometimes as little as two millimetres, but could grow to as large as five centimetres. Most of the commonly seen ones stay between these two extremes, but the fact of the matter is that they will usually grow at a slow pace over several years. Many remain small and will seldom exceed one centimetre in size. It is the rather small ones that many people are often eager to remove on their own at home, but this is not recommended or advisable as these are lesions and tend to bleed a lot. This can become a serious problem in those people who have a blood clotting problem. They can also become infected.
As stated before, this problem is often found in skin folds where there is a lot of friction between different opposing skin surfaces. In the majority of cases, it is not at all clear what causes it. There may be an increased risk of forming these tags in people who have diabetes and in pregnant women, possibly due to certain hormonal changes. This may also be the case among people who are overweight and frankly obese. There is also the likelihood that some people have an increased degree of susceptibility to developing this skin condition due to certain inherited characteristics. Other risk factors for developing this condition are those who have an imbalance in the relationships between their sex hormones, particularly if there are changes in the circulating levels of oestrogen and progesterone.
Besides, people with family members who have this problem do have an increased tendency to develop the condition. This is equally true of those who have certain types of human papillomavirus. There is also evidence that people who have abnormalities with their lipid profile and high cholesterol levels tend to have an increase in susceptibility to this skin condition. This has also been found in association with hypertension and advancing age. Because of these connections, there is now the suggestion that the development of skin tags may offer an external indication for some of these conditions.      
Some of these conditions like metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and polycystic ovary syndrome are now being said to be predictable when there is appearance of these skin tags. This is a research-based finding, which shows that these skin tags have been linked to situations of insulin resistance, which often predates the development of diabetes. Skin tags have rarely been found to develop on the penis and in the vagina as well. This latter aspect makes it clear that while we have named certain parts of the body where skin tags are commonly found to develop, there is theoretically no part of the body that can be considered off-limits to the formation of this lesion.
Largely as a result of these differences in places where they can appear, skin tags can usually be removed in a variety of ways. The treatment is offered depending on whether it is considered necessary to remove them or not considering where in the body they may be located. Generally, if they are multiple, it could be quite daunting to remove all the visible ones, but when they are considered to be cosmetically unacceptable, efforts must be made to get them off. These cosmetically unacceptable growths will include those on the eyelids and the neck for most people. Other parts can be different areas around the face where their presence could even become embarrassing.
The treatment of this condition largely depends on the resources available and the size of the skin tags. In a hospital setting, the use of cryosurgery through a device that freezes the growth by means of liquid nitrogen is often preferred. The other method is to use cauterisation, which burns off the growths. The more easily employed methods of treatment, which can be deployed in a clinic or at home, involve the use of ligatures, which when applied to the base of the peduncle connecting the tag with the skin, cuts off the blood supply to it. The skin tag dies off in the absence of blood supply and falls away on its own after several days. The last commonly used method for the removal of these tags is to be cut away by a doctor using a surgical blade.
This method is fraught with some risk as bleeding usually occurs and the attending doctor has to be ready to stop such bleeding. Removal of skin tags near the eyes often has to be performed by ophthalmologists.  In addition, there are a host of home remedies that have been employed through the ages in the removal of these growths. Some people have used apple cider application to the lesions with some success. Others mix aloe vera with apple cider for what they say is added efficacy. However, there is no evidence that the removal of these growths encourages more of them to form as a sort of replacement.
Finally, there are some solutions that are available in pharmacies and online stores that can be used for the removal of these growths. These solutions are often similar to those used for the treatment of skin and genital warts.  Related News   Lady asked to leave job interview venue due to her skin condition:I felt humiliated   
Questions and answers
Hello doctor. How is work? I am a medical laboratory technician. I have chest pain but sometimes I don’t feel it. It has stayed with me for six years but on some occasions when I wake up from sleep my chest hurts. It has passed the way it used to pain me before. Please doctor, I need your assistance. I am from Lokoja in Kogi State.                                      0806xxxxxxx
Well, this is an interesting situation and the kind of pain you are describing is something that is likely to be mild. You did not tell us which side of the chest pains you or what brings the pain about. All the same, I will urge you to go to a hospital and get properly examined by a doctor. That is the best way to know if something is wrong with you that is responsible for the pain.        
Hello sir, whenever I finish bathing with my sponge, my body itches me. Please what can I use to stop the itching? Thanks.                                 0906xxxxx20
Thank you for your question. The problem may be with your sponge. You should boil it to kill off all the microbes that may be hiding in it and then place it in the sun to dry. Alternatively, get another sponge.
Good day doctor. Please, how can I prevent myself from suffering from malaria frequently? I always have malaria and it is affecting my self-esteem because anytime my friends ask after me, I tell them I have malaria. The same thing is happening to my colleagues in the office. What should I do, please?                 0807xxxxxxx The answer is multi-dimensional. Keep insects out of the house by placing nets on your doors and windows. Get rid of stagnant water in your surroundings. Sleep with an insecticide-treated mosquito net and apply insecticides in your house on a regular basis while staying away from the pungent smell outdoors. In my experience, once you see any kind of insect flying around your house, it is time to spray your insecticide. Lastly, it is better to use more than one type of insecticide at a time so that mosquitoes that have developed a certain resistance to one type will succumb to the other. Lastly, you can add a medication like Mefloquine (Lariam) or Proguanil (Paludrine) on a daily basis for which your doctor will give you a prescription for a few months, usually three months, to allow you some time to recover from the recent spate of attacks. Good luck.
Good day sir. Is it too much to eat two boiled eggs a day? Thank you, sir.   0803xxxxxxx
For healthy adults, it is safe to eat one or two eggs a day depending on how much of other sources of cholesterol you have got in your meals. It is not likely that you may know that for sure, but if you do know that you already have high cholesterol in your blood, or have heart disease or hypertension, it is often better to limit your intake to four to five eggs a week. Therefore, most healthy people can take up to seven eggs per week without any negative effects on the health of their heart. Some people often choose to eat the egg white but not the yolk, which affords them some protein without the cholesterol. And so, for most people, eating two eggs a day is unlikely to affect their cholesterol level. In summary, therefore, eating two eggs a day is not too much.
Very many thanks for all the explanations to enquiries in your weekly column. What is your take on Acuflex capsules for restoring hard hearing problems? Do you recommend such? I am 70 years in age. Very many thanks.                            0802xxxxxxx Answer: Thank you very much for your comments sir. That preparation is very similar to the herbal medicines available all across the country and does not have the ability to restore hearing loss. If you have any challenges with your hearing, it is better to see an ENT surgeon who will advise you to undertake an audiology test that will show what kind of hearing loss you suffer from and at what level of severity. That test will enable you to get the proper advice you need. In many instances, it will be more beneficial for you to obtain a hearing aid. So, my answer is that it is not recommended for you to use Acuflex
Good evening doctor. Can I also start taking baby aspirin? I am 65 years old and a healthy man according to my doctor. Thank you.                     0802xxxxxxxx      
Answer: Well, baby aspirin is not a medicine that you just wake up and begin to take. You are not likely to derive any benefit from taking baby aspirin since you are in good health. Specifically, it is probably harmful for you to use this medication after the age of 60 years even if you had any systemic disease of concern such as diabetes, hypertension or heart disease.
Good evening Sunday doctor. If somebody is sure that they have malaria, based on experience, is it wrong to take anti-malaria treatment? Must such a person do a blood test first? I just want to know what is applicable. Thank you.    0803xxxxxxx Most people in this environment probably know how they feel when they have malaria. There is nothing wrong if you proceed to use an anti-malaria medication based on how you feel. It is such a pervasive problem, and the consequences of delaying treatment may be very damaging. That is why even pregnant women are encouraged to use such medications if they feel they have malaria. There is a caveat, though, and that is that if you fail to improve significantly after the use of such a medication it will probably be taken as an unfair practice if you do not get a blood test done for confirmation at least.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/15201925/Dr.-Sylvester-Ikhisemojie.jpg

It was the 130th anniversary of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and 18,000 men and women who fit into police uniforms for a career converged in the Pacific Coast city.
I was glad to learn that Nigeria’s current police boss, acting Inspector-General of Police Kayode Egbetokun, a man whose vision and courage I recently praised in this column, led the Nigerian delegation.
Curiously, Nigeria sent one of the largest foreign delegations to this year’s IACP: about 36 strong, I learned.  That suggests a distressing financial tab for Nigeria at a time of severe economic problems.  Keep in mind that those officers would have travelled First or Business Class, which this October would have been about $10,000 and $20,000 respectively per ticket, according to Google Flights.  And that is just the tickets. 
It is at once comforting and distressing to learn that the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs of the US Department of State sponsored Nigerian participants, among others, to San Diego. But while that sponsorship may have included hotels and expenses, the Nigerian government would still have had to pay heavy travel allowances, alias estacode.
On the website of the Nigeria Police last week, I could find no mention of the conference, despite police spokesman Olumuyiwa Adejobi being present. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which sent officers, did not acknowledge its presence either, let alone any contributions they may have made. Swift Reporters appeared to be the publication the Nigeria Police wanted to be mentioned in.
Previewing the conference, Mr. Adejobi had declared its theme, ‘The Real Advantage’, as providing “an invaluable platform for police leaders and professionals around the world to engage with contemporary law enforcement issues of global significance.”      
He said the conference would encompass a broad spectrum of discussions and workshops on such subjects as transnational fraud, officer safety, and wellness, use of force, innovative investigative techniques related to firearms, community and public safety, and cybercrime.
Adejobi further said that those concerns aligned with IGP Egbetokun’s “commitment to achieving professional competence, rule of law compliance, and people-friendly policing services,” and that the knowledge and insights gained would be “instrumental in advancing the IGP’s mission to maintain law and order and ensure the safety and well-being of all Nigerians.”
Those lofty hopes were being expressed at a time in mid-October, a time that Nigerians will always remember, and be reminded of the massacre of young citizens in a public protest in 2020, the most brutal incident of official repression and cover-up in the country’s history.
The Doris Okuwobi judicial panel of the Lagos State Government, in its 2021 report, confirmed that despite government denials, there had indeed been a massacre by soldiers who “shot, injured and killed unarmed, helpless and defenceless protesters.”
It further stated that the police officers who were deployed to the tollgate aided in the massacre because they “shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths.”
In effect, on the night of October 10, 2020, the Nigeria police openly mowed down young Nigerians in a peaceful protest about being brutalised by the police.  Related News   Police allegedly shoot father of three dead in Anambra  IG convenes security conference, retreat for senior officers  Elections: Police hold inter-agency security meeting   
Worse still, three months ago, an evidence leak revealed the horrendous truth that over 103 persons had been killed at that Lekki protest when it emerged that the Lagos State Government was planning a N61.2m mass burial for them. That confirmed previous reports that the police had taken away the bodies that night and cleaned up the crime scene.        
Evidently, this is not the kind of image the Nigeria police can clean up in international conferences, which may explain why it was reluctant to assert its participation in the IACP last week.
As I continue to say, policing Nigeria begins from the basic issue of orientation and character, as the nation’s police force appears to be trained to serve and protect the rich and powerful (as opposed to the maintenance of law and order), while treating the public with extortion and hostility.
Critical to this is the lack of accountability in policing. Until every policeman, from the youngest officer to the IGP, accepts and implements the principle of accounting for their work, those reports culminating in written public reports of state commissioners and the IGP, policing in Nigeria will remain a charade in which innocent people are routinely extorted, assaulted, tortured, thrown behind bars, or even killed.
How important is reporting? Here is the website of the annual reports of the SDPD. Here is the website of the reports of the City of San Diego. And here is the website of the reports of the IACP itself.  Now, show me a similar website of the Nigeria police in any form.
Reporting is what puts everything in place and perspective: from what we are trying to accomplish to what we are doing, and who we are. How remarkable it would have been in San Diego, for instance, for the police chiefs of the world to hear from their colleagues of the EFCC about their work, citing the annual reports of that agency, including its annual report for 2022 that was due three weeks ago.  How remarkable it would have been for IGP Egbetokun to speak about how many murders have been solved in the last 12 months, and how.
One more word about Nigeria’s participation at the 103th IACP: How did Nigeria’s Minister of State for Police Affairs, Hajia Imman Sulaiman-Ibrahim, become an interloper in a meeting of police professionals?
Membership of the organisation is clearly limited to “law enforcement and those affiliated with the law enforcement profession, including police leaders, officers ranging from recruit to command-level, law enforcement executives, nonsworn law enforcement personnel, criminal justice academics and students.”      
“The conference is a vital platform for sharing best practices, discussing emerging trends, and addressing critical global issues affecting law enforcement agencies,” Ms. Sulaiman-Ibrahim detailed on Instagram. “Over the course of this event, I’ll actively engage in panel discussions, delivering keynotes, and participating in bilateral meetings with esteemed leaders in law enforcement.”
Panel discussions? Keynotes? There is no evidence. The opening ceremony featured such relevant speakers as FBI Director Christopher Wray,  San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria,  Chief David Nisleit of the SDPD, and Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock.
What is even more embarrassing is that Minister Sulaiman-Ibrahim transformed into an Instagram influencer, posing for pictures, including a particularly embarrassing one in front of the San Diego Central Jail, and going on a Ride-Along with a police sergeant.
Hopefully, Ms. Sulaiman-Ibrahim will stay in her lane next time and let the professionals do their work. If she really wants to work, and not simply travel, she can visit a few of Nigeria’s 240 prisons and over 800 police stations and pose in front of their battered equipment. As Mayor Gloria said at the opening ceremony, “I don’t think people perform better or become more accountable or responsible when you deny them the resources they need to do their job…We would not defund but fully fund and fairly compensate officers and give them the equipment to do their job.”

She suddenly fell ill and we were told that she had to undergo emergency surgery. Although the surgery was successful, she was in very bad shape afterward.
On a particular day, one of her doctors walked in and said to her, “Aunty Grace, do not worry, you will soon go home.” When she was younger, she was like the “village belle” and was also from a high-profile family, so she was quite popular and younger people called her “Aunty Grace.” Here was someone who had no idea of her background calling her that name! She told me that immediately the doctor called Aunty Grace, memories of all that happened in our hometown while she was younger came flooding back and the urge to live suddenly enveloped her. Her health improved after that incident and she was discharged.
This story opened my eyes to the fact that mental health is important for overall health. October 10 of every year is World Mental Health Day and because our emphasis is mostly on physical health, I felt the need to talk about mental health.
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others and make healthy choices. According to the World Health Organisation, mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realise their abilities, learn well, work well and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. 
“Mental health is about the functionality of your brain and all that impacts it. Your mental health can impact everything about your life, including the ways you view and move through the world and your ability to handle the things life throws at you says Oludara Adeeyo, a psychiatric social worker and author of ‘Self-Care for Black Women’. According to Alison Seponara, a licensed professional counsellor and author of the book, ‘The Anxiety Healer’s Guide’, mental health helps determine how you handle stress, relate to others and make choices. She went on to say that caring for our mental health can lead to improved mood, reduced anxiety, clearer thinking, deeper relationships, and improved self-esteem and confidence.
Mental health is equally important for overall health. The mind-body connection is stronger than we may think. Experts have found that good mental health can have a direct and positive effect on physical health. The opposite is also true – poor mental health can have a negative effect on physical health. Now, this does not mean that if you have an occasional bad day or a stressful week your physical health is going to suffer as a result. However, it is an important reminder to not ignore or downplay mental health struggles or chronic stress and anxiety. In the same way you listen to your physical health needs, you also need to be mindful of your mental health needs.
Let us look at this situation for example. Not only can chronic stress and depression spur feelings of fatigue and a lack of energy, it can also affect your ability to get sound sleep. With a lack of sleep, symptoms related to stress, anxiety and depression can be amplified and in turn, make it even more difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Eventually, this can contribute to the development of sleep disorders, including insomnia or sleep apnea.      
Let us look at ways to improve mental well-being:

 Get restful sleep

Sleep is non-negotiable for physical health. It also plays an essential role in mental health. A 2021 study included data from 273,695 adults in the United States. The researchers found that people who averaged six hours of sleep or less per night were about two and half times more likely to report frequent mental distress than those who averaged more than six hours of sleep.

 Cut back on social media

“Constantly consuming information about other people’s lives may cause someone to compare themselves and promote feelings of low self-worth, which increases feelings of anxiety and depression,” says Adeeyo  Related News   Factors threatening maternal health and child survival  Sokoto psychiatric hospital sensitises residents to mental health  Tips for coping with spouse’s mental health condition   

 Strengthen your relationships

Humans are social creatures and strong relationships can have a positive influence on your mental health in various ways. Friendships, for example, can ease feelings of loneliness, make it easier to get emotional support and add meaning to your life.

 Move your body on your own terms

Exercise offers a range of mental health benefits, including relieving stress, lifting mood, helping you fall asleep faster and longer, and helping you manage symptoms of depression and anxiety conditions.
Movement can involve something different for every person and it does not have to mean going to the gym unless you genuinely want to. Instead, make movement enjoyable by opting for physical activities that work best for your body, health and preferences.

 Savour nutrient-rich foods

Certain foods can also affect your mental health. To support improved mental health, try expanding your current diet to include foods packed with mood-boosting nutrients like berries, bananas, beans, whole grains and fatty fish. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can also have benefits. “When you are dehydrated, you are denying your brain and body the nutrients needed to survive and operate at a more optimal level,” Adeeyo notes.        

 Get some sunshine

“The sun is a great source of Vitamin D and studies show it can improve attitude and mood,” says Christopher S. Taylor, PhD, LPC-S, founder of Taylor Counselling Group, author of ‘My Digital Practice’ and host of the ‘For Self-Examination’ podcast. Your outdoor time does not have to be long either, “Five minutes of blue skies can do your mind and your heart some real good,” Taylor adds.

 Talk to someone you trust

Opening up to someone you trust can help you feel listened to and supported. It could be a friend, partner or family member.

 Learn new skills

Research shows that learning new skills can also improve your mental well-being by boosting self-confidence and raising self-esteem, helping you to build a sense of purpose and helping you to connect with others. Even if you feel like you do not have enough time or you may not need to learn new things, there are lots of different ways to bring learning into your life.

 Do something you enjoy

Try to make time to do an activity you like on a regular basis. This could be cooking meals and getting in touch with a friend.

 Take a break if you need to

If you are feeling overwhelmed by a stressful situation, try to take a break. A change of scene may help you to relax and relieve feelings of distress.

“My parents’ marriage has been troubled since 2021 when my mum discovered that my dad has another child outside. My dad did not deny anything but things have not been the same between them since then.
“He said he had been apologising but my mum kept telling him ‘Go and face your child and her mother and leave me and my children alone’. He said he doesn’t relate with the girl’s mother again. He also said it was a mistake that happened on a night he was not himself.
“The reason I came to you is that my dad informed me that my half-sister gained admission into the same university that I attend. My dad is also telling me that he wants me to meet her and start keeping an eye on her in school. I am close to my dad but I don’t want to betray my mother. This whole issue affected her so much that she almost lost her job that time.” 
She stated further, “I don’t know how to handle the request my dad is making of me. I don’t know how I will start seeing that girl after everything that is happening between my parents. My mum is very angry with my dad’s family because she feels they know everything that was going on and they supported it. Please, help me with your advice. I will be 20 years old very soon. I don’t know the age of my father’s daughter. He only told me her name. She is already bearing our surname.”
From Oby,
This is probably the part of family life that most men do not understand.      
Children don’t do well with an upset in the family because the life they encounter out there is enough stress and family remains one place they run to for peace of mind.
Sometimes, it’s not about a woman being jealous that her husband slept with another woman.
The best way to describe it is, watching a supposed oneness of spirit that marriage symbolises crumbling!
It makes a woman feel not enough, defeated, hopeless, unsafe and resentful.
What I find most selfish of men is how fast they expect everyone to accept their unsavoury deeds and carry on as if everything is OK.  Related News   Choices men make  Girls, sleeping with a man for money does you more harm than good!  Prostate cancer: What every man should know   
The father that is foisting a step sibling on this young lady has not even given her the time and space to process her feelings about all these or does he think she likes his deed?
These are ways we let our children lose faith in the emotional safety net that the family is supposed to be for them. And the next thing will be them seeking that succour out there via drugs, sex, wrong peer influences, etc.        
When a married man chooses not to overstep certain boundaries, it’s not because he is ‘not man enough’, it’s because the upset these things cause in the family is often not worth it at the end of the day.
 I say to men, it is most insensitive to foist this kind of relationship on your children.
Give them enough time to process everything and then come around in their own way.
Don’t force them to start a sibling relationship with your other child yet.
Just have an honest conversation about the reality with your spouse and children and leave the matter alone.
Time will take care of a lot.
On the advice you seek, I have learnt that what people don’t have to know, they don’t have to know about it, especially if it’s something that will hurt and not benefit them in any way.      
I don’t think you want to compound your mum’s hurt; she is already having a hard time dealing with this.
Let every action of yours be geared towards her healing and peace of mind.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/08070231/Chukwuneta-Oby1.jpg

This is because it is becoming common that, for many of them, the way to promote their imported pharmaceuticals and medical equipment is to bad-mouth the products of traditional medical practitioners. I think any attack by western medical practitioners on traditional medical practitioners amounts to belittling what’s indigenous to us. No serious nation should permit this. Science and modern medicine are helpful, but I don’t think western medical practitioners who make money from them have any right to talk down on what others do.
The other time, one Nigerian medical doctor was promoting his imported surgical equipment on TV and his method was to bad-mouth the products of traditional medical practitioners. I’m not convinced this person needs to talk like this in order to promote his imported equipment. Yet he did. I suppose it’s because there’re no restrictions against this on our media platforms. Anyone comes, casts others in a bad light, and no one warns them. It’s a trend that has been going on for some time among western medical doctors, especially those who don’t see anything good in what is traditional, natural, indigenous.
I did make submissions on this page regarding this issue several times in the past. I don’t belittle traditional medicine because I know it works. I don’t belittle what is indigenous because I believe when we source solutions here, we don’t take our money outside to enrich other nations. But some who are trained in western medicine don’t have this worldview. They import what they don’t contribute to making, and because they want patronage they demean what is ours. It’s a mentality I condemn in every way possible. These are people whose parents and grandparents lived into their ripe old age by using herbs that are ours. But they forget all of that and start bad-mouthing what we have. Note that the same indigenous traditional solutions are what, for instance, the Chinese have and they make billions of dollars out of. In Nigeria, what is traditional is projected as bad by those whose narrow view of everything is exactly that – narrow. They do this often because no one calls their attention to what they miss, no one engages them in debates that make them examine what they say that mostly aren’t thought through.
It’s worthwhile to remember that many herbs used earlier on to develop some drugs in the western world were taken from the tropics which included places such as Nigeria. Later, artificial versions of properties in these herbs are made in labs and this is how some western drugs become exclusively made in these western nations. But we still have the natural and original thing here, which I know from scholarly writings are less dangerous to the human body than the artificial equivalents. I watched a documentary where a western scientist was lamenting the rate of destruction in parts of Nigeria of some rare plants with rare medicinal properties. Some of these plants haven’t even had their properties fully researched and documented. But they are being rapidly destroyed. Here, many don’t care, particularly Nigerians trained in western medical practice who import all things for their business while they dismiss what we have here. 
The reader would understand why I take on this topic if they understood that I believe in what is natural 100 per cent, as well as in the saying that “prevention is better than cure.” Use what is natural for preventive and curative purposes and it saves anyone the headache of depending on drugs made with chemicals. It’s been my experience for decades. What is natural is plenty here, but western medical practitioners who want to make money from what they import won’t tell you this.
They won’t openly tell you to watch what you eat, live a balanced life, rather than depend on expensive drugs. They won’t tell you that those plants and trees in your neighbourhood are medicinal and can deal with the same issues they ask you to purchase expensive drugs for. These guys must sell drugs and use hi-tech equipment that they import to Nigeria on you, so they won’t take their time to tell you these things. Someone lost his wife and he told me that it was after this unfortunate incident a western medical practitioner sat him down for a talk. This western medical practitioner told him that living on drugs perpetually isn’t really safe. After years of using the same drugs for an ailment, the blood vessels of the listener’s wife became blocked with residue such that further uses of the same drugs didn’t deal anymore with the ailment. Most western medical practitioners wouldn’t ever mention this.

This silence by western medical practitioners over natural things that people should do in order to prevent dependence on drugs, or even falling ill, was something I called attention to during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. That time, the World Health Organisation announced that people should stop taking alcohol, ostensibly to prevent COVID-19 infection, because it wasn’t effective. My question in my column then was: So what should people take so that they could prevent catching COVID-19? (The PUNCH, April 17, 2020). At the time, one Nigerian – long on insults, short on reasoning – and with the usual narrow view called me names for expecting doctors and the WHO to tell people what natural things to take in order to prevent falling victim of COVID-19.      
After another column that I wrote the WHO responded by saying people should eat foods that were natural and exercise as well, in addition to observing other COVID-19 protocol (See: “Straight-talking WHO and doctors are what we need”, The PUNCH, May 1, 2020). Note that the WHO mentions foods that are natural. I’ve always believed in the positive health effects of foods that are natural long before the WHO said it. I also know that our people know herbs that can take care of most aliments, and in the past I mentioned on this page how herb preparations used by our people assisted people close to me to recover. I witnessed it as a child. I grew up believing in what our people were able to use herbs to achieve. Nature didn’t give only the white man ability to find cure to ailments. Nature gave black man too. But some black people belittle this because they import western drugs and hi-tech medical equipment with which they make money.
My conviction that the black person has vast knowledge in the area of curative medicine is one reason I would advise any Nigerian to take natural herbs to prevent or treat ailments rather than swallow drugs ceaselessly. Apart from the known argument about the right doses to take, natural herbs hardly have any side effects; but most processed drugs do. These are the same natural herbs used by traditional medical practitioners whose work some Nigerian western-trained medical practitioners bad-mouth.
It’s only in Africa people pull down what is theirs which they ought to promote. I suppose, particularly in the area of medical practice, people who are raised swallowing drugs for anything and everything have no problem doing this. There’s no problem since it’s the only solution they believe in. No one stops them from maintaining their sophisticated taste. But they should abstain from talking down on what others believe in. These include the use of African traditional medicine, which is essentially made up of herbs and roots. It’s cheaper and easier to access for millions of Africans especially with the known dearth of hospitals in remote locations. If traditional medications don’t work for them, they wouldn’t have so many practitioners around offering such.
Traditional medications work, for instance, for the Chinese and it’s one reason that sector of the medical industry continues to boom in that nation. The Chinese government doesn’t discourage it, and I’m sure no western medical practitioner in that nation will go on air to bad-mouth what is indigenous to China. They call for improvement in traditional medical practices, but they don’t dismiss them. I think it’s high time media houses in Nigeria forewarned advertisers on their platforms to concentrate on what they know rather than bad-mouth others. They should leave others to what they too know.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/24083013/Tunji-Ajibade.jpg

In a certain nation, a military base had four soldiers guarding a concrete slab in front of the barracks. Under the commands of different high-ranking soldiers, guarding the concrete slabs became a tradition. Soldiers changed shifts performing the guarding rituals. One day, a curious and questioning commander was posted to the base. He wanted to know why soldiers were guarding the obstructive and obtrusive monument of sorts. The more he dug to unravel a reason, the more annoying the answer he got about the tradition.
“We’ve always done it this way. It’s our tradition. Our former commanders instructed us to do that,” the new commander was told. But he refused to stop digging. Later, he came across an old document in the archives that had an explanation. Over 80 years prior, an active service commander had issued a command regarding the concrete slabs. The reason got me laughing out loud. At that time, the military base wanted to build a platform where some recreational military events could be performed for military families. The work on the slabs was done overnight but before dawn and while all the soldiers were off the area, wild animals from the bushes turned the concrete into a playground. The beasts would mess up the concrete job before it dried up. And the following morning, the work had to be done all over again.
The commander then ordered that four soldiers should guard the concrete slab for three weeks to allow it to dry. The following week, and before the concrete finally dried up, the commander was transferred to another post and a new commander replaced him. Every new commander found the routine and continued to enforce it. For over eight decades, four soldiers continued to guard a piece of brick that had been turned to a god that needed protection. The exercise continued as a nauseating routine and tradition until the curious commander took charge and asked questions about the enemy called routine.
The word ‘routine’ is defined as a sequence of regularly followed actions, and a fixed programme that is supposed to help us achieve more and stress less. Routine is also a regular, habitual, and predictable cycle of human acts and activities. As a recycled and repeated act over a span of time, routine may truly make a person become the master of an art. Intense and intentional immersion in it may activate the resurgence of a dying potential in a breathing being. Through routine, connoisseurs are delivered in the labour room of consistent and persistent practice. When worked and woven aright in an enterprise, benefits of routine are bountiful. The flip side of this enemy is what I’m addressing in this week’s opinion. 
I have a definitive abhorrence for routine exercises that permit rut to ravage a family, run a business and ruin it, or cripple a nation. Doing the same thing over and over again with no impactful result is sickening. I’m not a fan of the unbending and un-bended unprofitable way of life; and the weird traditional path travelled in doing business that serves no progressive purpose. If you are a wise man or woman going somewhere great in life, you should loudly loathe routine.
 Kathleen Rooney is the founding Editor of Rose Metal Press out of Chicago, a city not too far from where I call home. Rooney once quipped in one of her poetic submissions: “If one knocks oneself out of one’s routine—and in so doing knocks others gently out of theirs—then one can now and again create these momentary opportunities to be better than one is.”
 A heart that’s not open to doing things differently ends up reaping the baneful fruits of routine. Routine is always a comfort zone that becomes home for people who fear rocking the boat or making new moves that could add value to life. For governments in certain climes, routine has ploughed paths that encourage corruption, thereby destroying positive impacts of governance on the people. A nation’s workforce enamoured with routine will have no desire to change ways of doing business because ugly tradition puts funny money in the already deep pockets of certain apparatchiks of government. Anytime an attempt is made to disrupt an old trend, they come after you as if you are the problem, not them. The enemy called routine.

In any relationship, routine is a monster that devours the future in the present. Many marriages lack spice and fire because husband and wife are sticklers to routine that rocks relationships into torpedoes. Why can’t we learn to be spontaneous? When are we going to conquer the fear of launching out into the deep to try new things?
Routine is a monster you must murder for your star to shine. The human spirit lives on creativity and dies in conformity to routine. Don’t let routine lodge in your bloodstream as virulent venom poisoning your life. Entrenched routine halts people from singing a new song.
If many years ago, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison had embraced the routine of existing sources of light in their time that always came from the fixed fire in the grate, and candlelight and oil lamps providing dim light around the home, they wouldn’t have invented electricity.  If in the 1920s Scotsman John Baird had surrendered to the routine of just reading books, listening to the radio, playing musical instruments, and engaging in hobbies like knitting or painting, and solving puzzles as forms of entertainment; he wouldn’t have invented the television. Men like Vannevar Bush, JCR Licklider and Vint Cerf despised routine. They jumped on the new idea of the Internet envisioned by the US Government when it erected the World Wide Web. Today, humanity has access to a lot of information because some men dared the enemy called routine.
Routine can be likened to the treadmill where you run fast, sweat profusely as legs hurt, hands hurt, head hurts, heart aches, breath is shallow, and at the end, you cover not one inch of distance in your journey. Biblical Egypt was a routine space to the children of Israel. The latter preferred to tarry in a foreign land instead of trying something new that the fingers of God had prepared for them in the promised land. They didn’t understand that if you love the promised land of your dreams, you must dare to try something new.
I conclude with this thought. Waste is a Siamese twin-brother of routine. Many people have wasted their destinies because of their love for it. In the concrete slabs story expressed at the outset of this treatise, for a long time, resources were wasted by the military establishment over the senseless routine of guarding a mirage. Soldiers trained to be productive in deployment were conditioned to guard a shadow that served no military or life purpose. Instead of living as a man of routine, live as a man of many routes. Your skills and talents are probably many and routine has made you foreclose on exploring deep deposits in you.  The things you can do are probably many. Your talents are your assets. Access and deploy them to work for your next level. Break the cage that routine may have built around your life. If what you do now is not bringing the requisite fulfillment, could that be a call to reroute from routine? Only you have the answer.

Here’s the tale of Erelu Bede, a woman who lived in the time of Orunmila, the Yoruba deity of wisdom and divination. The Araba of Osogbo, Chief Ifayemi Elebuibon, told me this tale in detail. The tale grew popular and became a collection in the series of Ifa teachings called Ogundabede.
In this article, I intend to use the tale of Ogundabede aka ‘Ikunmú àgbà’ as a metaphor that weaves the power of language and culture into a tapestry, like a hairdresser using the ilari cutting comb to part the customer’s hair into three per time before weaving each three into strands of knee-length box braids. ‘Ikunmú àgbà’ is the mucus in the nose of the elderly, difficult for the young to point out.
Hear foolish parents raising children in their fools’ paradise, “I don’t want my children to suffer the suffering I suffered!” Ask them what ‘suffering they suffer’, and they tell you how they trekked to fetch water from the village river every morning before trekking to school kilometres away.
These parents fail to realise the difference between labour and indulgence. A Yoruba proverb believes labour doesn’t kill, overindulgence does. The freedom and choice of adventure is the reason why ‘local’ chicken is sweeter than ‘agric’ chicken. One is given the free range to roam while the other is locked up in the cage for safety. Overprotection inhibits flourish. And nothing ventured, nothing gained. The most expensive cutlery in the world cannot give the taste and tactile feeling the palm gives when it helps pounded yam explore edikang ikong soup for ponmo, crayfish, bokoto and snails. 
It’s absurd how some industrious parents overindulge their children in the good life, losing the essence of hard work, diligence, perseverance and consistency in the process.
Erelu Ogundabede lived in an era when baby mama-ing wasn’t a badge of honour among female survivors of dysfunctional relationships. An impending doom loomed large for Erelu. She must perform a series of sacrifices to avert the danger of having three kids for three different husbands, warned the gods. The ingredients of the etutu (sacrifice) were three goats, three pots of cowries and three sashes (òjá). She must perform the sacrifice three separate times.
The prophecy that made the heart of Erelu skip hippity-hop would have been a cause of celebration among the younger generation of today, male and female. But Erelu Bede lived in a time when morality defined marriage. Erelu became sad because she had no money to procure the ingredients of the sacrifice. She devised a plan. Only kings have such money to throw around.      
So, she went to King Alara and told him her story. Alara married Erelu and performed the first round of sacrifice for her. And she begot a son. Erelu urged King Alara to perform the other two rounds of sacrifices but the king told her to tarry awhile. Erelu was unhappy that Alara couldn’t solve her problem, so she left the king after naming her son, Igara, meaning that the king maltreated her.
She went to another king, this time, the Ajero, and told him her story, and King Ajero married her, performing one of the rounds of sacrifice for her. She urged the king to complete other rounds of sacrifices but the king told her to tarry because there was a paucity of funds. Erelu begat a son, whom she named Òfòrélé, the son of Ajero. Òfò is calamity in Yoruba.
Worried about the last sacrifice, Erelu went to King Orangun, told her tale, and the king, Owarangun Aga, married her. She bore another son to Owarangun, whom she named Amuni nje amuni.
Thus Igara became the first bandit in the human race. He teamed up with his two other half-brothers to form a formidable gang of robbers, attacking people on market days. One day, they waylaid Aje, the wife of Orunmila, and snatched all her money. Aje reported her calamity to Orunmila, who gave her a bag to sling across her shoulder on the next market day. The three-brother gang struck again, snatching Aje’s bag.
They went to their rendezvous under the Iroko, where they shared their booties. The bag was heavy, must contain more cowries, they thought. Igara unfastened the bag and dipped his hand into it. Haaaaaa! He threw the bag to the ground and ran off in pain. Òfò and Amuni felt Igara had run off with some money. Both struggled for the bag. Òfò snatched it from Amuni. He dipped his hand into it. Sss-hh-aaa! Òfò flung the bag away and ran off, too. Amuni was glad he had the whole bag to himself. He slung it across his neck and dipped his hand into it. “Yeeepaaaa!” he wailed and struggled to throw the bag off, running a short distance before slumping to a painful death, like others.  Related News   Again, singer Dammy Krane calls out Davido over alleged debt  VIDEO: Moment Davido received Best Male Artist award at 2023 Trace Awards  FULL LIST: Davido, Rema win big at 2023 Trace Awards   
A cobra snaked out of the bag into the forest. Erelu couldn’t have all her children for one man because she failed to perform the three sacrifices in one fell swoop.
If we blame Erelu for impatience, we should blame the kings for jibiti because she came clean with her problem; the kings shouldn’t have married her when they knew they didn’t have the money for all the sacrifices. This is my personal view, may the gods not twist my mouth for blasphemy.        
The lessons inherent in this tale are many. One of them is the preeminent place of mother tongue in teaching. Another is the beauty of culture as the custodian of customs, traditions, habits and practices. No African, nay Yoruba son or daughter with understanding, wouldn’t relate to this tale more than they relate to Shakespearean language, more so if it was told in Yoruba.
It is ridiculous that Nigerian leaderships since independence have failed to evolve comprehensive curricula that would promote learning and teaching in Nigerian languages. This would aid assimilation and develop native languages.
I often wonder what is the essence of speaking in foreign languages in our mosques and churches, only for interpreters to translate what’s said in foreign tongues into English or local languages. Why don’t you preach in Nigerian languages and skip the hurdle of translation and time-wasting? In the kingdom of God, there’s no language imperialism as God understands all tongues.
I wonder when Nigeria would break the shackles of self-imposed mental slavery and stop barring workers from wearing bùbá and sòkòtò to the office all through the week, except Fridays and weekends. Bùbá and sòkòtò are smarter than suit and tie. If you’re in a suit and tie, please, don’t argue with a bus conductor.
Anytime I wear Nigerian clothes in the US, heads turn in admiration, mouths open in compliments. Americans, whites and blacks, love diversity and many are quick to ask where they could get African clothes.
Wave-making Nigerian music stars including rave-of-the-moment, Asake; Flavour, Phyno, Tiwa, Yemi Alade, Wizkid, Davido, Burna Boy, Olamide, Portable employ Nigerian languages and cultures to deliver their messages. Many of these stars enjoy regular airtime on American airwaves. It’s ironic that many parents home and abroad don’t encourage their children to speak Nigerian languages but they enjoy songs in Nigerian languages. Understanding one’s language and culture has a cutting edge.
I wish Nigeria a quick restoration to its old glory. I wish the ‘Japa’ syndrome would cease so that the country could stop losing its future leaders to foreign countries. Many Nigerian kids abroad have lost their mother tongue. They speak English better than native speakers. Whose gain? Whose loss? When Nigerian kids abroad grow up, they don’t fit into the cutthroat existence of Nigeria anymore. Whose gain? Whose loss? Is ‘Japa’ truly another slavery?      
Whatever you do, wherever you are, encourage your children and wards to embrace their language and culture. There’s something about Nigeria that the world would soon wake up to – if our leaders fetch their thinking caps quickly enough.

columns,The insult they gave us as palliatives,"The video of an angry Nigerian rejecting a quarter-bag-of-rice state government’s palliative has been trending, especially on the social media. In the video, the man directly addressed the governmen...","<span class=""post-date""> 19th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/the-insult-they-gave-us-as-palliatives/,  Greg Odogwu,"The video of an angry Nigerian rejecting a quarter-bag-of-rice state government’s palliative has been trending, especially on the social media. In the video, the man directly addressed the government, telling whomever was viewing not to “insult us with your palliatives.” This is because, according to him, the 10kg bag of rice he was holding was given by the government of Ogun State to be shared among citizens living in his estate of 147 households. He wondered how such a small quantity of food items would go round among these residents.
In saner climes, this video would have outraged the entire nation, for it is a true representation of the sad situation we presently find ourselves as a people. The government has thrown a handful of grains at us in the name of palliatives. The poor – who are in their tens of millions – scramble to get a share, but end up going home empty-handed and humiliated while the politicians cash out from this pyramid of rent-seeking enterprise called palliative distribution. For those who are still determined to protect their human dignity at all cost, it is tantamount to a rude slap on the face.
The Federal Government removed the subsidy on petrol, and said it was going to create measures to cushion the avalanche of adverse multiplier effects on the hapless citizens. They called it palliatives, the same word that was used to whip the poor masses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, at that time, some poor Nigerians died while struggling to get just a handful of them. Yet, not only were these palliatives physically hoarded, they were also digitally used to cook the books. This is why we must recognise them for what they are – a code word for political largesse shared among greedy leaders who seek out every opportunity to milk our malnourished economy.
Truth be told, palliatives and other emergency makeovers – like the three-month conditional cash transfer and the promised “wage award” – are monumental subterfuge. But, sadly, we live in a universe of lies: We lie to ourselves and we allow our leaders to lie to us with impunity. Even when their dishonesty gets so heaped that it seems the mountain of falsehood could be seen from afar, we enable them to whitewash the façade, and then start erecting another edifice of untruths. Indeed, they have finally realised that they can get away with any sin under the sun. They stopped lying in mere words; they now lie in poetry and rhyme. Sometimes, having realised that we condone their depravity, they sing and dance as they build the blocks of these structures of sophistry. 
But this is not supposed to be so. The last time I checked, Nigeria is peopled with very sophisticated and cerebral Africans. It is high time we stopped bandying this word “palliative.” It is nothing but a decoy. When the politicians drive with a crown of thorns on our head, they give us a cold drink in order to momentarily divert our attention from the damage they have done. Past governments have done it; the present administration is now playing by the same text book.
President Bola Tinubu’s removal of subsidy on petrol has plunged the country into hardship. Then as part of the so-called palliatives to alleviate the suffering of the citizens, he asked the National Assembly to approve N500bn for the masses from the 2022 Supplementary Appropriation Act. The lawmakers quickly approved the release of the fund because there was something in it for them. The proposed palliative was so glaringly lop-sided. While just about 12 million indigent Nigerian families would get a monthly cash transfer of N8000 for six months, the just over 300 new lawmakers were penned to be showered with N70bn “support allowance.” Not only that, N40bn was also allocated to buy 465 sports utility vehicles and bulletproof cars for members and principal officials.
When Nigerians got wind of this injustice, there was a loud outcry. The president then suspended the implementation of the proposed palliative. He later came up with a new package of doling out N2bn to each state government to share among the citizens. This is how we got to where we are today, a comical one-man-one-grain sharing formula.      
I also saw a video where a town of 20 communities was given a “Dina truck” of two hundred 25kg bags of rice to share as palliatives. I was dumbfounded watching a handful of villagers who witnessed the berthing of the truck of rice as they broke into celebratory songs. Little did they know that they might not receive up to a cup per person when the sharing begins.  Related News   Gombe palliative committee submits report, 42,000 households benefit  Osimhen: Can he surpass Yakubu’s goal record?  FCTA begins distribution of palliatives   
The whole scenario is evocative of how deep we have sunk. Alas, these politicians must have bewitched us! For, how can we justify pretending to be asleep as they throw bones and leftovers in our direction while feasting on our commonwealth?
Meanwhile, as citizens still wait to get their handful of grains, the legislators are about to take delivery of brand new SUVs which they claim would help them carry out their duties. The saddest part of the story is that they dump local rice on us while insisting on buying foreign cars for themselves.
These politicians are not even thinking of cutting down on the cost of governance. Well, it is not only the legislators that are guilty; all our leaders have sinned. The president himself had been leading the charge from the get-go. He has been appointing ministers, right, left and centre. He has created new ministries, and split existing ones, ostensibly in a bid to accommodate his loyalists and patronise his core supporters. He seems to have settled on “big government with a big shopping list.”
Our expenses are ballooning, and the only idea they just came up with is to go to the World Bank for a $1.5bn budget support loan. Anyway, it is not bad to borrow if it would be used in national ventures that have lasting value and return on investment. But when we borrow just to buy foreign food, flashy cars and sharp apparel, then we are on a highway to the south.
Ironically, our leaders are not afraid of us – the citizens who put them in office. That is the major reason they misbehave. They know we are not going to do anything about their debauchery. Of course, they are ready with the crumbs to throw at us in order to keep us quiet.  For sure, they know that once the loan comes, and they cut out a meager percentage in the name of palliatives, we shall leave them in peace to enjoy their bounty, piling up debts for our children yet unborn.
I am of the view that true palliative is supposed to have a lasting value, not just momentary oil for the stomach. For instance, the Ecological Fund was created as a palliative to cushion the impact of ecological disasters. Although the FG mismanages it, the prime objective of the initiative is to have a pool of fund that would be solely devoted to the funding of ecological projects to ameliorate serious ecological problems nationwide.        
The Oxford dictionary has two definitions for the word palliative. The first is medical: Medicine or medical treatment that reduces pain without curing its cause. The second meaning is marked as “disapproving”: an action, a decision, etc. that is designed to make a difficult situation seem better without actually solving the cause of the problems. It seems our leaders have masterfully appropriated the negative connotation of the word, and it is perfectly working for them.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/03133815/Greg-Odogwu.jpg

Akin Rotimi, regarding the procurement of 360 Sports Utility Vehicles is heartbreaking. In the statement he issued on Sunday, the lawmaker representing Ekiti North 1 (Ikole/Oye) Federal Constituency displayed as much arrogance as he displayed ignorance. Nigeria deserves better than those elected to serve them.
First, Rotimi justified the purchase of vehicles worth between N160m and N200m when millions of Nigerians were destitute even by the book. His press release revealed that the House of Reps must purchase a pool of such vehicles every four years. Given the giveaway prices that legislators can predictably obtain these vehicles because of the government’s asset-deboarding policy, one can hazard a guess that every member would prefer to retain the vehicles. So, we must buy new vehicles every time new members enter the chambers.
Let us assume without conceding that this expensive routine is necessary for the legislature to function effectively, the question arises: are there no cheaper alternatives?
For instance, there is at least one car manufacturing company in Nigeria. What about purchasing cars from such companies? By doing so, these men and women, charged with the responsibility of making life easier for Nigerians, would be boosting the country’s economy by improving productivity and possibly creating more jobs. Such consideration is even more expedient at this time when the country is in dire need of foreign exchange. At this time, members of the National Assembly will purchase over 400 luxury cars and boost the economy of some far more economically comfortable country. 
Secondly, if these vehicles are strictly meant for the oversight functions of legislators, as Mr Rotimi would have us believe; wouldn’t the purchase of buses have been more sensible in the circumstances?
Rotimi also exhibited the arrogance of power we often get from people like him in his press release. While acknowledging that he and his friends at the House of Reps felt that they owed Nigerians an explanation in the matter, all he did was confirm the speculations that these vehicles were being purchased despite Nigeria currently in economic dire straits. But he only disclosed without disclosing. The statement disclaimed the N200m cost placed on each car in social media, but it refused to tell Nigerians their actual cost. Such selective transparency ultimately amounts to opacity. The people who elected these lawmakers deserve nothing more than absolute transparency, and teasing them with token information signposts the contempt with which they hold the electorate.
One of the most unfortunate consequences of Rotimi’s Sunday intervention was his display of the remit of the House of Reps. He said, among other things, in his statement: “It is also not peculiar to the legislature, as unelected government officials in the executive arm of government from director level and above, in most cases, have official vehicles attached to their offices.” Maybe he is right. However, when did the executive become the standard by which the National Assembly or any legislator should measure itself?      
At that point, it became clear that many of the characters in the National Assembly aspire to this office just to get a piece of the national cake. They neither have ideas about the import of their office nor do they care. Why do I say this?  Related News   Ganduje canvasses constitutional roles for deputy govs  Kinsmen endorse Sylva for Bayelsa gov  Plateau PDP, military disagree over member’s abduction   
To my mind, the 1999 Constitution makes the legislature the most critical arm of government in Nigeria. It is like the anchor that holds the vessel from drifting. With the powers to make “laws for the peace, order and good governance of the federation or any part thereof…” granted by the constitution and the powers to conduct investigations, otherwise known as oversight, given by Section 88, the National Assembly stands in the best position to ensure the fulfilment of chapter two (Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy) of the 1999 Constitution. They make the laws that enable the executive and judiciary to function, and they are also granted the powers to monitor the effectiveness of these laws, query their implementation in the case of the executive, and review the laws when the desired impact is not achieved. So, what has happened to the National Assembly since 1999? Why is it just waking up now?
So, members of the executive, elected or not, can be excused for doing whatever they like since the constitution provides checks and balances from the power vested in the National Assembly. When the institution with the power to check the excesses of another arm of government now justifies its actions by the performance of those it should oversee, you should know there is trouble. What Rotimi said to us in that part of his statement is that, regardless of what Nigerians are going through, members of the National Assembly must satiate their exotic and greedy taste because the “unelected government officials” of the executive do it.
I found it interesting that he mentioned “unelected.” Mr Rotimi should know that the fact that he and his colleagues were elected imposes more duty of care and a higher standard of accountability on them. While unelected people can run riot and exploit the reign of impunity in the country, people like Rotimi, who sought and obtained the people’s mandate, owe the people and the country absolute diligence and responsibility. It is tragic that our legislators do not know or pretend not to know this.
What is worse is that neither upbringing nor party affiliation distinguishes these legislators. Membership of the National Assembly currently comprises members of at least six parties. These include the All Progressives Congress, the Peoples Democratic Party, the New Nigerian Peoples Party, the All Progressive Grand Alliance, and the Labour Party. Sadly, we have all these parties, and they are on the same page about this decision that shows the insensitivity of our leaders.
The only inference we can draw from this is that the entire political class does not have the interest of Nigerians. Nigeria would possibly not be in the present state where people are ravaged by hunger and illiteracy were the National Assembly single-minded in its oversight function. But compromises, mostly hinged on personal aggrandisement, led to dereliction of duties to the detriment of the national economy and the people. An immediate example is the treatment of ways and means provisions under the last administration.
Nigerian parliamentarians are beginning to parade as people’s enemies without realising it. But they must realise that even though more people become more impoverished daily, they are not stupid. So, they must change their disposition promptly. For a country that borrows to fund its budget and even service its debts, Nigeria deserves more than legislators who carry on prodigiously with little care for the present and future of its people. Continuing with this wickedness is the easiest way to incur the people’s wrath. Our politicians must avoid that by every means possible.

Of this figure, Garuba said 51 were false. The “suspects” who raised the alarm have been charged to court for “giving false information and inciting public disturbance.” I am genuinely curious about two things: first, the eleven cases remaining and, second, how the police ascertained those lying.
A ready answer would be that those men were checked by competent medical personnel and found “intact.” If they were truly lying, what would they have gained from inciting the public and subjecting some poor innocent victim(s) to potential mob justice? That is a question I am sincerely invested in getting answered. What if these men’s claims, though not factual, also carried no intent to deceive? What if they claimed their penises were stolen because they were struck by a psychosomatic condition?
There are two sets of responses I have seen to this phenomenon of missing penises. On one side are the believers, people who take every instance of alleged occult or supernatural occurrence at face value. Every story about money ritual, spirits and ghosts, shape-shifters, demonic agents, is to be believed and defended as a manifestation of “African Science.” These are the ones who boast that Babalawos in villages without potable water or electricity can suspend natural realities. To challenge their thinking is to give yourself away as an inauthentic African suffering bouts of colomentality and cannot acknowledge that Africans have indigenous ways of knowing that which supersedes modern science.
The other set is the sceptics who dismiss these stories outright as impossible. Sometimes, they would superciliously berate the primitivity of African minds that will not let go of stupid village tales and embrace the logicality of “science.” It seems to me that the police fall into this second category. The series of warnings they have issued about “false alarms” suggest they are taking the rationalist position. But what if the sceptics’ position is just as unfounded as that of the believers? 
What we call the “stolen manhood” phenomenon is neither new nor even “African.” Penis panics have been recorded in various forms of literature for centuries. Now diagnosed as “Koro,” the condition describes a state of anxiety where a man believes his penis is shrinking, retracting, or disappearing altogether and that he would consequently die. While medical studies have their own term, the society where it happens has always found some abstract or material factor to blame. In Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, it was attributed to witches. In Singapore in 1967, they blamed the phenomenon on pork poisoning. The price of pork fell drastically, and the hysteria only died down after public officials campaigned that the cases of disappearing penises were a psychological issue. In China in the 1980s, they blamed theirs on the “fox spirits” migrating from place to place. Those spirits were believed to possess beautiful women, and some were consequently killed. The men in the communities it happened were so consumed with fear of losing their penises that they walked around with various contraptions attached to keep them from disappearing.
In Africa, cases have been recorded in Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Congo Republic, Central African Republic, and Cameroon. Across time and space, the various documented cases have a certain consistency that suggests that the bodies of those men truly experienced something that their minds translated into being robbed of their genitals. Medical literature says that the retraction these men felt could be reversed in hours or even days. So, if someone is taken to the hospital after they have raised the alarm and their penises are found to be functional, it does not mean they lied initially.
In a place like Nigeria where belief in the occult is rife, such accusations are not to be taken lightly. In public places where the alarm is raised, there is always an ignorant bloodthirsty mob waiting to unleash violence. In 2001, at least 12 cases of lynching over stolen penises in the South-West were reported. Between Nollywood and religious houses, people have been so fed an idea of evil that they imagine that some forms of evil can be destroyed for good.        Related News   Army to conduct battle simulation in Abuja  VIDEO: Yahaya Bello denies assassination attempt on life, says its fake news  NCoS sacks two, sanctions 35 others for misconduct   
These people only need to hear a man accuse another of stealing his penis, and they would transmute into beasts to launch judgment. Such alarms—and the violence that inevitably follows—are almost always a male affair. While there are a few documented cases of women who have claimed their breasts were missing, Koro is more popularly documented in men. That peculiarity partly has to do with the male anatomy where the penis is an offshoot and partly with social construction of manhood.
Anthropologists have found that the phenomenon of stolen penises correlates with economic stress and social anxiety that keep men from evolving through demarcated social stages. The penis is a biological and physical symbol of what we designate as the becoming of a man: physical and emotional maturity, procreation, and even economic independence. It is the one thing that separates men from women, and that is why the male fears of feminisation—of not being man enough—revolve around that part of their body.
The anxieties of not measuring up to social standards of manhood define men throughout their lives. There is a joke that men will swallow just about any potion that promises to increase their virility. It is funny because it is true. There is a reason urban centres in Nigeria are replete with all kinds of concoctions brewed by “native doctors” promising to make a sex machine out of insecure men.
Today’s Nigeria has enough stress to rob a man of manhood. That is why looking inside the men’s underpants to determine whether they still have their penis or not produced such an inadequate result. If 51 out of 62 cases examined turned out to be “false alarms,” the police should be curious if their meter for adjudging these issues is not falsely calibrated.
Nigeria faces a protracted economic crisis and social upheaval that trigger angst in people every day. Whenever you thought things could not get worse, it does just that. There is no sense of social progress, and many Nigerians are justifiably angry, desperate, and frustrated. Walk on the streets these days, and you practically feel the tension exuding from people and making them restless.
Now and then, a person launches into an outburst about being robbed of the very biological instrument they need to assert their personhood and a crowd of men for whom the cultural neurosis resonates jump out of their idling spaces to enact an extreme violence they hope would assuage their deficiencies and reassure them they can still do the things men are supposed to do—be a defender. What that momentary feeling of rage gives them is a feeling of control. In that one moment, they presume they have identified a source of the evil robbing them of vital life sources. Destroying it is cathartic.
While I understand why the police cannot afford to brook “superstition,” I also think they should be open to understanding cultural psychology. Those men—I do not know how many of the 62—raised the alarm because they had a physiological disorder fed by sociological conditions. Treating them as liars does nothing to educate a society that believes a penis can be stolen, and the supposed thief can be apprehended and punished. At best, the police are merely reactive. It would be more productive if they embarked on public education to preempt manifestations of Koro in public places and the violence that typically follows.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/28025026/Adelakun-Adunni-Abimbola.jpg

On December 19, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 66/170 to declare October 11 of every year as the International Day of the Girl Child, to recognise girls’ rights and the unique challenges girls face around the world. This year’s theme was, ‘Invest in girls’ rights: Our leadership, our well-being.’ Different organisations organised events to mark the day. Goodwill messages were shared on social media and other platforms expressing how we cherish our girls.
From my desk in the newsroom, I saw a female colleague going around to record short videos while asking ladies to say “Happy Girl Child Day.”
While that was going on, a news story landed on my desk that I needed to work on. It was the story of a father who has been sleeping with his 13-year-old daughter for three years. That means he has been defiling the innocent girl since he was 10! It took the efforts of some teachers in the girl’s school to notice something strange in her behaviour and reported to the principal who in turn handed her over to the school counsellor before the girl opened up. I think the teachers and the school based in Ikorodu, Lagos State deserve a commendation.
Like a recurring decimal, the following day, another story landed on my table and it was about a young man who had just finished his national youth service who defiled another 13-year-old girl, a daughter of his benefactor who housed him and promised him a job. 
Those cases were just two among the numerous stories of defilement that I have been coming across lately and the trend, to say the least, is disturbing.
There are cases involving girls that are younger than 13. It appears there is no limit as far as this insanity is concerned: fathers defiling daughters; teachers defiling pupils, men defiling neighbours’ daughters, clerics across all religions defiling worshippers’ daughters. Sadly, no state is spared of this shame. Examples abound.
In June, a 39-year-old man was arrested by the police for allegedly defiling a nine-year-old girl in Ugbogi Community in Ighobazuwa, the Ovia North West Local Government Area of Edo State. The suspect was said to have lured the victim to his room, had sexual intercourse with her and given her N600 after the act.      
In the same month, a 20-year-old man from Tike quarters in Bajoga, the Funakaye Local Government Area of Gombe State was apprehended for defiling a five-year-old girl.
In July, a 23-year-old man was nabbed for allegedly defiling a 16-year-old student of the Government Technical College, Ado Soba, in the Trade Fair area of Lagos State. The girl was on her way to school when the suspect accosted her around 6 am and forced her into his apartment against the minor’s will.
In August, a 56-year-old man was arrested for allegedly defiling his 11-year-old daughter in Anambra State. The suspect, a native of Adazi-Enu in the Anaocha Local Government Area of the state, was said to have committed the act at his residence in Fegge, Onitsha.  Related News   Bizarre pleasure: Sad stories of mentally-ill  women raped, impregnated by randy men  Entrepreneur promotes gender advocacy  Foundation distributes pads, writing materials to Imo students   
In a twist, even a visually impaired man appeared before an Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court in Lagos State for allegedly defiling a 13-year-old girl.
In March, there was a more pathetic case of a 27-year-old man arrested for allegedly defiling a nine-month-old baby at Railway, Ijora Badia, in the Apapa-Iganmu Local Council Development Area of the state. Yes, you read it correctly; the victim was a nine-month-old baby!
A shameless father took his case a notch above other randy men by defiling three of his underage children at his residence in the Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia State. The girls were aged 14, 12 and eight.
I won’t bore you with more heart-rending cases of these shameless acts that are available in their hundreds. As you are reading this, a distraught girl may be crying silently in your neighbourhood.        
Are these men okay at all? Are they normal? What exactly is the point of attraction? Some said such acts have a spiritual undertone, insinuating that perpetrators may be doing it for ritual purposes. Some others said they may be committing heinous crimes under the influence of drugs that are not in short supply in the country.
These beasts of men have given all men a bad name. A man with a clear conscience can no longer carry a girl in his arms while talking to her without some penetrating eyes focusing on him. Parents are now afraid to allow their daughters to go and spend holidays with their uncles. Mothers are no longer comfortable leaving their girls with their neighbours while they rush to the market. When girls return from school, parents now want to know what those male teachers did to them or told them. Even in churches, mothers dare not leave their daughters in the hands of pastors for special prayers. The situation is not different in Quranic schools or mosques. Anywhere you turn to, the fear of randy men is the beginning of wisdom.
Where can these girls run to for help? Some state governments have been trying in this regard. The Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency under the leadership of Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi has been responding to this ugly trend over the years. The agency has launched a mobile app and web portal for stakeholders to track, monitor, and manage gender-related cases in the state. The law establishing the agency whose mandate is to provide and coordinate end-to-end response to incidents of domestic and sexual violence in the state and the Sex Offenders Register was assented to by the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on September 20, 2021.
Bisi Fayemi, wife of a former governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, also took the lead in the fight against sexual offences in the state while her husband was in the saddle. A sex offenders’ register was also opened in the state. The courts in the state also did a good job then with the news of convictions coming almost daily. Despite these efforts and others, this ugly trend appears not to be declining.
We cannot afford to leave our girls in perpetual fear of what may befall them because of these randy men on the rampage. All hands must therefore be on the deck to tackle this. People should stop keeping quiet on this menace. When you see something, say something like that popular jingle said. Lawmakers should also consider stiffer punishments for offenders. For instance, their jail terms can be spiced with hard labour. These men can be made to be sweeping the streets every day of their jail term. Let them be made to be clearing refuse on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and other highways with their bare hands.
Honestly, I am bothered about this trend and all right-thinking people should be bothered.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/19212706/OLALEKAN-ADETAYO.jpg

All these are attainable and envisaged in two broad concepts of democracy and good governance. Many Nigerians do not want military coups because of the draconian way soldiers govern. Under a military junta, rule of law is absent. There is no constitutionalism or supremacy of the law, neither is there strict observance of fundamental human rights. Equality before the law is also a hoax under military regimes.
Conversely, strong pillars of democracy include rule of law, separation of powers, checks and balances. In a true democracy, there is a regular conduct of elections, vibrant media, independent Judiciary and pro-people legislative assembly. In a democracy, the three arms of government are separate, though inter-dependent. They also act as checks on one another. The executive implements the law made by the legislature, the judiciary interprets the law and adjudicates disputes among the three arms. In an election, there is universal adult suffrage. Once you’re 18 years and above, you can register to vote at elections. Every registered voter, be you master or serf, moneybags or powerful individuals, everyone gets a chance to vote only once. The constitution has also guaranteed the freedom of press and power to hold the government to account.
These features and ingredients of democracy made it preferable to autocracy or dictatorial rule. Imagine that an individual who felt aggrieved can sue the government or any of its agencies and get favourable judgment. Democracy however is not an end in itself. It is a mere means to an end. The ultimate goal of democracy is the enhancement of good governance and development. Section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution says the primary purpose of government is security and welfare of citizens. It is only a democratic state that holds the constitution as sacred and inviolable.
Moving from the above theoretical framework to the practical plane, Nigeria, this year, is celebrating a centenary of electoral democracy. Recall that the first set of elections took place in 1923 after the coming into force of the Sir Hugh Clifford Constitution of 1922. What have these 100 years of elections delivered to Nigerians? Nothing special! It’s been more of misery, poverty, unemployment, underdevelopment, high cost of living rather than high standard of living. This is the prime reason for few electorate at elections. Voters ask what their previous exercise of their franchise has brought to them. They are disillusioned. The fact that election, as a democratic tenet, hasn’t delivered dividends of democracy made voters vote with their feet rather than with their fingers. 
It is Nigeria’s Fourth Republic since independence in 1960. During the First Republic, we experimented with the parliamentary system of government of our colonial masters, the British. Barely six years into that voyage, our national ship capsized as the military forcefully seized the reins of government on January 15, 1960, citing rigged 1964 /65 national elections, corruption and bad governance, among others. After 13 years, there was a return to civil rule in 1979. This time, we decided to jettison the parliamentary system for the presidential system of government. This was modelled after the governance system of the United States. That is the system we have been toying with since 1979. Yet, it hasn’t delivered the much touted good governance! Remember, the military struck again on December 31, 1983 for much the same set of reasons as it advanced in 1966.
After a culminating 29 years of military adventurism in Nigeria’s politics and governance, we are very much stuck in bad governance with attendant features such as abuse of office, corruption, poverty, unemployment, infrastructural deficit, and insecurity.  While we have succeeded in routinizing elections as we have been conducting our polls as at when it falls due, we have not been able to overcome our developmental challenges. All development indices are pointing south, (negative) for Nigeria. Take for instance, the country has the highest number of out-of-school children globally. Also, the World Poverty Clock reported that there are 71 million extremely poor Nigerians, according to 2023 data. The National Bureau of Statistics classifies 133 million people as multidimensionally poor.

In April 2023, a global audit and tax advisory firm, KPMG, projected that Nigeria’s unemployment rate is expected to rise to 40.6 per cent as compared to 2022’s 37.7 per cent. KPMG detailed this forecast in its International Global Economic Outlook report – H1 2023 on Tuesday, April 11, 2023 where it stated that “unemployment is expected to continue to be a major challenge in 2023 due to the limited investment by the private sector, low industrialisation, and slower than required economic growth and consequently the inability of the economy to absorb the 4-5 million new entrants into the Nigerian job market every year.”      
Nigeria ranked 8th among the top 10 countries with the highest level of terrorism in the world. This is according to the Global Terrorism Index 2023. This was the outcome of assessment of terrorism impact in 163 countries. With a score of 8.065, Nigeria has a terrorism impact that is “very high.”  The SUNDAY PUNCH of March 10, 2023 reported that Nigeria’s misery index has soared by 11.9 percentage points to 73.05. The misery index is a measure of economic distress felt by everyday people, due to the risk of (or actual) joblessness combined with an increasing cost of living. The misery index is calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to the inflation rate.
According to a UNDP 2021 rating, Nigeria is ranked 163rd in the United Nations Human Development Index for the second consecutive year, a new report by the UNDP shows. In terms of the HDI score, Nigeria remained unchanged with 0.535. That’s Nigeria’s scorecard in a century of electoral democracy. Very heart-rending and disheartening! Any wonder Nigerians are embracing irregular migration to supposedly saner and better climes?
Nigerians have once again for the seventh time since return to civil rule in 1999 voted for a new set of leaders to pilot the affairs of this country for another four years. 11,082 political offices made up of a president, 36 governors, 774 local government and area council chairmen, 8,809 councillors, 993 state Houses of Assembly members, 360 House of Representatives members and 109 senators have all taken their positions across the country. The ensuing challenge is to govern well and deliver the dividends of  democracy to the citizenry.
The president last Monday, October 16, 2023, had a full complement of his cabinet after swearing in additional three ministers to the already inaugurated 45. With 48 ministers which is the highest ever, plus the President, Vice President, Secretary to the Federal Government, Chief of Staff, Head of Service and National Security Adviser; this brings the cabinet to 54. To me, it is bloated and unwieldy! However, I do hope these ministers and other government appointees will roll up their sleeves and positively contribute to the eight point ‘Renewed Hope’ agenda of President Bola Tinubu. At the sub-national levels viz states and local government areas, the expectation of good governance is high and I do hope the three arms and the three tiers of government will be able to positively impact our lives and deliver the much expected development. Nigerians earnestly yearn for good governance!

As the social media is muddling up the story, the protagonists are throwing potshots at each other.
As former Vice President Atiku Abubakar takes his doubt about the veracity of the Chicago State University certificate that President Bola Tinubu presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission to the Supreme Court of Nigeria, it becomes sub judice to discuss it publicly.
Failure to discuss the matter in public may sound like when a Yoruba deigns to publicly acknowledge that the King’s mother is a witch! The public sphere is an open space where citizens may interrogate issues.
The only risk to speaking in public is in a statement attributed to former Uganda despot, Idi Amin, who reportedly said that while your right to speak might be guaranteed, you freedom and safety after that would not be guaranteed. 
The matter of Tinubu’s identity and the veracity of his Chicago State University and other certificates have become fodder for all manner of “experts,” who express their opinions as if they were “facts.”
One should point out that there are so many wild allegations and counterclaims made by partisans of Tinubu, Atiku, and Peter Obi, yet no one is quite clear about the true state of the matter.
As a self-appointed investigative journalist, David Hundeyin tells the court of public opinion that Tinubu presented a forged certificate to INEC, BBC Global Disinformation Team’s fact-check reveals the contrary.      
Reuben Abati, co-Anchor of Arise TV The Morning Show, thinks the Labour Party presidential P, Peter Obi, who told a press conference that Tinubu should just come clean about his identity, is merely seeking attention.
Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, no fan of either Tinubu or Atiku, has weighed in on Tinubu coming out to clarify things so that everyone would know the true status of things.
Solomon Dalung, member of the ruling All Progressives Congress whose tenure as  President Muhammadu Buhari’s Minister of Sports and Youths ended abruptly in 2019, called the President out in a dramatic, if not juvenile, manner.
He posted his Ordinary Level, Bachelor of Law, Master of Law, and Call to Bar certificates on the social media, and declared, “I voluntarily made my credentials available for public scrutiny. The reason… is stemming from the ongoing intense international and national brouhaha surrounding the issue of academic credentials in Nigeria.”
Then he added, “The President of Nigeria and his political allies are going from one court to another in America and Nigeria, regarding their credentials. Now, what is going on has made everyone in Nigeria, who has a certificate, a suspect.”
Some people have dug up their own dirt on Atiku, who they claim used the aliases, Atiku Kojoli, to write his first School Leaving Certificate Examination, and Sadiq Abubakar, to write his West African School Certificate Examination.
They ask if a man with such muddled records can question the credentials of Bola Tinubu, who now questions the credentials submitted to INEC by Atiku, who claims to have a Master’s degree, while his Bachelor’s degree is not quite pronounced.        
To the unintended situation normal all fumbled up that has arisen from Atiku’s negligence, one can only say, “Aye nse ‘ru e,” which is Yoruba for things like that sometimes happen.
If Atiku thinks Tinubu partisans will just accept his explanation, it means that he is not fully prepared for the consequences of a hornets’ nest that he has stirred. Like elections, propaganda has consequences.  Related News   
This should remind you of the “If You Tarka Me, I will Daboh you” tit-for-tat that came out of the corruption scandal that rocked the regime of the Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, in the early 1970s.
A group within the Labour Party threw their own dirt on Peter Obi, their party’s presidential candidate. They claimed that he used the identity of his late elder brother and that the names on his Ordinary Level, Bachelor’s degree and National Youth Service Corps certificates are different. Obi is yet to deny the allegation.
The Tinubu presidency, through Temitope Ajayi, its Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, seeing an opportunity to strike back and pay Atiku in his own coin, took an opportunity to throw its own vicious jab.
It says: “Alhaji Atiku Abubakar went to America, to look for President Tinubu’s certificate, and also to find out whether he went to school as a female or male, why (sic) he himself is not even sure of his own name in Nigeria.”
As smart-ass as Ajayi’s retort may sound, it does not really help to clarify the identity status of Tinubu. Neither does it confirm if President Tinubu obtained his Bachelor’s degree certificate directly from Chicago State University, or if he took the “Oluwole” option that some people insinuate.      
Though you must also note the Chicago State University claim that the description of Bola Tinubu as a female in their documentation is a clerical error, Tinubu haters have conveniently ignored this pertinent claim.
To lay all these doubts and innuendos to rest, the President should just tell Nigerians who he really is and the source of all his credentials. If he had taken advantage of the CNN interview offer, maybe he could have nailed the issue permanently.
After all, Tunde Odesola, a columnist with The PUNCH, has “confessed” to his juvenile past of once tweaking his school results, the way former American President, Barack Obama, confessed to smoking marijuana.
But the communications group of the Tinubu Presidency does not seem to know its public relations responsibilities to the President. They should tease out the “facts” and the “truths” of the credentials of their principal and make a statement to clear the air. No congregant has ever been prosecuted for what they told a Father-Confessor.
The way to do it is to sit down with the President, for a frank and open discussion, after which they would frame their narrative. They should invite media executives for open, but off-the-record discussions, to seek a joint approach to broadcasting the adopted narrative.
The America-based Nigerian Tribune columnist, Farooq Kperogi, has done a lot of groundwork for them. All the communications group needs to do is walk the President through the findings for confirmation and vetting.
Simon Kolawole, Publisher of The Cable, who worked with Atiku’s TheWeek magazine that interrogated the Tinubu certificate gaps in 1999, is a resource waiting to be tapped– though he adds that TheWeek never queried Tinubu’s Chicago State University certificate.  
This is the way former American Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, used to do it, whenever he wanted the buy-in of the entire American media system in support of an unpopular policy that is, however, in the interest of the people of America.
But why doesn’t the mainstream media jointly take it up from the David Hundeyins and Reno Omokris, investigate the claims and counterclaims, and confront Tinubu, Atiku and Obi with whatever “truths” they find out?
This is the approach that will best serve democracy and the people of Nigeria.

This is irrespective of their relationship status or path towards having children.
In a statement made available to our correspondent, the lender said that it launched the enhanced global parental leave benefits for its employees effective September I, 2023.
The Bank said the standardised parental leave allows parents to take on more equitable caregiving responsibilities for their children.

We believe benefits such as this help address globally prevalent societal norms around traditional roles, improve workforce participation and provide options to those who want to take up shared childcare responsibilities. This will positively impact families’ financial wellbeing and create a more inclusive workplace that supports each individual’s unique family planning choices.

At times...,"<span class=""post-date""> 17th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/explore-the-power-of-the-active-voice/,  Akeem Lasisi,"A sentence is in the active voice when the subject is performing the action. The subject is the doer of the business in the expression but it is not every time it is allowed to play the role. At times, it is acted upon, giving rise to what is called the passive voice. So, in the passive voice, the object of the clause as well as the verb is elevated to the initial position while the otherwise landlord (subject) is edged to the rear and is thus subjugated:
They blamed the referee. (Active. THEY performed the action.)
The referee was blamed by them. (Passive. The REFEREE, which is the object, comes forward while the subject (THEY) receives the action.)
Mbappe will play the penalty. (Active) 
The penalty will be played by Mbappe. (Passive)
Many experts argue that the active voice is more desirable than the passive. As a result, they urge that the latter be sparingly used.  Although the passive voice has its own advantages, here are five factors that highlight the power of the active voice:
Prominent positioning      
The active voice gives the doer the prominence and honour they deserve, according them good positioning. So, when you want the reader or listener to know the performer of the action, or you want to emphasise the role the subject plays, put the sentence in the active voice:
Bola built the house. (Nobody else did it.)
We cut the grass.
The Obafemi Awolowo government built the Cocoa House.
Authority
Close to the above is the issue of not robbing the subject of the authority it commands – especially when people in the positions of authority are involved:
    The Ooni blessed the people during the festival. (Active voice.)        
    President Tinubu appointed him as a Special Adviser. (Active voice.)
Shorter and smarter
The active voice keeps the clause shorter and, usually in language, the shorter the smarter or better – unless you want to lengthen the expression for a particular effect:
He saw the men. (Active. Four words.)
The men were seen by him.  (Passive. Six words.)
Adamu built the house. (Active)  Related News   FG okays $3.45bn W’Bank loan application for power, others  The powerful mind!  FG grows national grid power capacity to 14,000MW   
The house was built by Adamu. (Passive)      
Clarity
The active voice enhances clarity. If care is not taken, the passive voice can make a sentence draw like the statement of a drunk person. So, it is often advisable to explore the active which makes the sentence brisk and clearer.
I ate rice. (Active)
Rice was eaten by me. (Passive)
She needs a longer ruler – preferably a newer  one. (Active)
    A longer ruler is needed by her – preferable a smoother one.
Intransitive verbs  
It is only the active voice that works with intransitive verbs. Remember, a transitive verb is the one that takes an object while the intransitive one does not.
Transitive: wash
I will wash the clothes. (Active)
The clothes will be washed by me. (Passive)
 Intransitive: dance
I will dance. (Active)
Would you say ‘(Dance will be danced by me’?  The fact is there can hardly be a sensible passive version of ‘I will dance’. In other words, a sentence whose verb is intransitive cannot be converted into the passive voice. In any case, it does not have the object that will usurp the role of the subject.      
Functions of the passive voice
Note, however, that the above analysis does not suggest that the passive voice has no place in the English Language. It does. It is, for instance, useful when you do not know the doer of the action, when you know it but do not want to reveal it or when you want emphasis on the receiver rather than the doer of the action. Study the following examples and revisit the lesson we dedicated to the passive voice (November 22, 2016):
The table had been laid before I got there. (Whoever did so is not much of concern.)
I learnt the market was attacked yesterday.
The market has not been rebuilt.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/25182115/Akeem-Lasisi.jpg

On the surface, that ranking showed that Nigeria’s private universities have arrived. They are no longer to be seen as “glorified secondary schools” as many used to tag them. But it portends danger.
In the Times Higher Education’s 2024 rating, Covenant University, University of Ibadan and the Federal University of Technology, Akure were recorded as the top three universities in Nigeria.  Even though Covenant University came first in Nigeria, it was placed within the global 801-1000 range in that ranking. That is not good news to Nigeria. But there is more that can be gleaned from the ranking, which should make every Nigerian worried.
Until recently, many people would vow never to send their children to any private university. Employers of labour also looked down on graduates from private universities. The assumption was that these private universities were not well equipped to train students to become dependable graduates. Many saw them as merchants who were more concerned about the money they stand to make from students than the knowledge they would transfer to the students.
However, many factors have been leading to a change in perception. The first is the issue of perennial industrial strikes by lecturers of universities owned by the Federal Government and state governments. These strikes last for months. The latest – which occurred last year – lasted from February to October (eight months). If a normal academic session lasts nine months, it means that students of public universities lost one academic year to strike in 2022. 
Sometimes, when the academic staff is done with its strike, the non-academic staff commences its own. At other times, it could be the students themselves embarking on a violent protest which leads to the closure of the university. As a result of these disruptions, students spend more years than they are supposed to. Some students spend up to six years on a course that is supposed to last for four years.
Another reason is the dilapidated and inadequate facilities in the universities. Libraries have outdated books and non-digitalised facilities. Laboratories are poorly equipped and unfit for experiments. Classrooms are too small for the number of students. Chairs in them are run down. Hostels are too few and poorly equipped, with up to 10 students living in a room meant for four. Some students even sleep on the floor.
In addition, lecturers in public universities are frequently accused of exploitation and victimisation. There are regular accusations of sexual harassment whereby female students, especially, are blackmailed to offer sex in exchange of higher scores. There are also accusations of lecturers victimising students who fail to buy their books or printed lecture notes called handouts.      
There is also the challenge of opaque rules and corruption in the admission of students into the public universities. Students who have higher scores in the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination most times get bypassed for others with lower scores. They end up spending some years rewriting the exam, losing time and getting frustrated.  Related News   Nigerians and labour productivity  No warning before next strike, Labour tells FG  Strike: Labour accuses FG of delay, NLC exco meets today   
Finally, there is the challenge of the questionable lifestyle in the public universities. Issues of secret cults, drug abuse, violence, rape, modern-day prostitution, suicide, intimidation, etc, are usually more rampant in public universities. Most of the first-generation private universities are owned by religious organisations who have stringent rules on how students should behave. Those who breach the rules get rusticated. And after paying the high tuition fees, nobody wants to be sent out of the university. In Nigeria, a teenager who fails to acquire university education does not have other options of what to do.
As a result of these factors, the private universities have been attracting more attention in the last two decades from Nigeria’s middle-class families. Those who either don’t want their children to go abroad for their tertiary education or those who can’t afford it see the private universities as a better option than the public universities. This is heightened by the fact that it has become the standard for children to finish secondary education at about 16 years. Today’s parents are more protective of their children and don’t feel comfortable having them at such young age spend four years or more in a public university where the rules are lax.
With the drop in the quality of education from the public universities, there has been a rise in the quality of the graduates produced by private universities. Employers and others who used to sneer at graduates from private universities have started to change their attitude. It is becoming a thing of pride for people to flaunt themselves as graduates of private universities.
Therefore, although the first-position Covenant University took in the latest ranking of universities is a sign that the quality of education coming from private universities is on the rise, there is more to it than that. One warning that this rise is giving to the nation is that the tragedy that befell Nigerian public primary and secondary schools is about to befall the public universities.
While growing up in the 1970s and 80s in my Nnewi hometown in Anambra State, there were no private primary schools and secondary schools. All the schools were owned by the government. Eventually when private primary schools began to emerge in the 1980s, they were seen as of lower standard and sneered at. But soon, their pupils began to show brilliance and class. The public schools were getting dilapidated. Parents who had the wherewithal did not want their children raised in schools with leaking roof or broken ceiling. Gradually more people began to send their children to private schools, which culminated in the tragic situation the nation faces now, whereby only the children of the poor still attend public primary and secondary schools.
The public primary and secondary schools, which produced the political and business leaders of the country, have all been abandoned because the state governments and Federal Government cannot maintain them. Old boys and old girls of the respective schools continually raise funds to renovate these schools, but they continue to get bad. In contrast, schools run by religious bodies and individuals are well maintained. The only challenge is the high fees they charge. Today’s parents, most of whom attended public schools, do not ever want their children to attend the same schools they attended, except the schools that were handed over to missionaries.        
What is staring us in the face as a nation is that in the next decade or so, very few people will be sending their children to public universities. Private universities and foreign universities will be the destination of virtually every child whose parents can afford the fees. The same fate that befell the public schools will have befallen the public universities. Ordinarily, there should be no worry about that, since they will produce the same graduates. But Nigerian private schools and universities – except those that have been handed back to missionaries – don’t have the full environment and curriculum to produce well-rounded individuals. For example, most public schools have very small compound with no fields for sports and other extra-curricular activities. Most of the greatest sports men and women Nigeria produced were discovered in secondary school or university.
Therefore, it is very important that public schools and universities run side by side with private ones, so that people will have a choice. That will also ensure that the rich and the poor all get educated and given the same opportunities in life.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/17111448/Azuka-Onwuka1.jpg

The general thrust of the discourse has shown that due process is not being followed in most of the debt transactions at all levels of government. Factual illegality and lack of due process can only lead to one conclusive end vis, the unsustainability of the debts incurred, because the procedures were set down to cure the mischief in existing law prior to the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
S.45 (1) and (2) of the FRA provides for one the biggest elephants in the debt procurement process. It states that: “All banks and financial institutions shall request and obtain proof of compliance with the provisions of this part before lending to any government in the federation.” Furthermore: “Lending by banks and financial institutions in contravention of this part shall be unlawful.”
By the above provision, banks and financial institutions are under a positive legal obligation to ensure that there is compliance with the provisions of the FRA before lending. The word used to qualify “unlawful” is “shall” which implies that it is mandatory (not discretionary) for banks to apply the provisions of this section. Banks are under obligation to request and obtain proof of compliance with the FRA before lending. It is also a directive to the courts to ensure the voiding of contractual obligations entered into in violation of the provision. When banks lend without following the provisions of this Act, the transaction is unlawful.  What is the legal status of an unlawful lending transaction?  Can the bank recover the loan from the debtor? The term “unlawful” has been defined as contrary to, prohibited or unauthorised by law; acting contrary and in defiance to the law. When the term is applied to agreements and the like, it denotes that they are ineffectual in law because they involve acts that cannot be recognised as grounds for legal rights because they are against public policy.
In Sodipo v Lemminkainen (1985, 2 N.S.C.C., 1102 at 1114., 1115), the Supreme Court held that a contract expressly or implicitly prohibited by statute is illegal and the courts cannot enforce illegality. Prof. Itse Sagay in Nigerian Law of Contract states that where a statute prohibits or bans the making of certain types of contracts, such contracts when made are illegal and void at law. The legal maxim is ex turpi causa, non-oritur actio meaning that a cause of action in law does not arise from a base cause. If the agreement of the parties is to subvert the provisions of the FRA, then the maxim will apply. Furthermore, parties to an agreement regulated by statute are expected to contract within the framework and contemplation of the statute. The law has also been stated as follows: 
It is the law that a contract is illegal if the consideration or the promise involved doing something illegal or contrary to public policy or if the intention of the parties in making the contract is thereby to promote something which is illegal and contrary to public policy; and an illegal contract is void and cannot be the foundation of any legal right. Where the subject matter of the promise is illegal or where the consideration or any part of it is illegal, the contract is illegal.  Related News   Three-year blueprint: FG plans N26tn borrowing, N29tn for debt servicing  FG should halt the frenzied borrowing  Nigeria’s borrowing: ‘Trouble’ imminent, says Budget Office   
Therefore, lending in contravention of the FRA when properly challenged in the courts may lead to inability of the bank to recover the debt or at best the recovery of the principal without the accruing interest and fees.  Ordinarily, only parties to a contract have the locus standi to enforce or repudiate its terms. This is based on the concept of privity of contract. It has been severally held that a contract cannot be enforced by a person who is not a party to it; even if the contract was made for his benefit and purports to give him a right to sue on it. However, S.51 of the FRA states that, “A person shall have legal capacity to enforce the provisions this Act by obtaining prerogative orders or other remedies at the Federal High Court, without having to show any special or particular interest.”Therefore, any person can seek a declaration that a loan transaction is unlawful and ask the court to prohibit a state or a bank from consummating the transaction or claiming rights under it. This position can further be justified under the equitable doctrine propounded in Roberston v Wait (1853 8Exch.229) and Lloyd’s v Harper (1880, 16 Ch.D 290) to the effect that a party to a contract can constitute himself a trustee for a third party of a right under the contract and thus confer such rights enforceable in equity on a third party. The government under the constitution and the social contract is a trust and governments act on behalf of the entire population and as such, everyone has an interest in the enforcement of laws, the rule of law and its due process.
Banks and financial institutions are therefore advised to tread cautiously and stop the continued granting of loans, especially to sub nationals who have been borrowing without meeting the conditions stated in the FRA. But the question arising is, which authority grants the proof of compliance anticipated in S.45 of the FRA? S.44 (4) of the FRA unequivocally invests the authority on the Fiscal Responsibility Commission in the following words: “The commission shall verify on a quarterly basis, compliance with the limits and conditions for borrowing by each government in the federation.” The authority that verifies compliance automatically should be the one in a position to state that the conditions have been met.      
In the final analysis, it is important that all tiers of government return to evidence-based debt procurement, management and repayment based on the unambiguous provisions of the FRA. The fact that we are servicing debts with virtually all our actual revenue at the federal level shows that the rules were not followed in debt management. The FRA did not contemplate this as a sustainable debt position. The ball is back in the court of the Ministry of Finance, Debt Management Office, and the Fiscal Responsibility Commission.

Economic theory ri...,"<span class=""post-date""> 16th October 2023 </span>",https://punchng.com/nigerians-and-labour-productivity/,  Sheriffdeen Tella,"One major problem with increasing domestic production in Nigeria can be linked to low labour productivity. The problem must be tackled from the sides of the employers and employees. Economic theory rightly tells us that labour productivity is key in production. Without labour, capital remains inactive. That is why wise countries do not care about how much they spend on human capital development. It pays off in the end. The developed economies, particularly Japan, the Asian Tigers and of course, China, are worthy examples of returns on investments on human capital. But it is not just about education, it is education with character.
Nigerians under normal circumstances are hard-working but the normal circumstances hardly exist anymore. For a long time now, we have invented “Nigerianness” into every aspect of life. The ‘Nigerianness” connotes negative behaviour. We talk about Nigerian time, Nigerian dressing, Nigerian address, Nigerian work ethics, Nigerian this and Nigerian that. People are becoming lazy every day, just as begging has become part of the tradition even of those tribes that used to abhor the practice. Even many people who are working and earning salaries have added begging as part of their income generation activities. When a country is about “what is in it for me” or “get rich quick” or everyone worshiping money, you can only expect cheating and not productive engagements.
When I read in the papers that the Dangote refinery imported a large number of labour from India to work in the company, I thought the labour unions would soon kick since there are laws limiting the number of foreigners that can be employed to work in a particular company. This is apart from the thinking that it is unethical for a Nigerian company to ignore the unemployment level in the country in the process of job creation and job placement. From the labour unions, nothing is being heard on the issue till today while from the streets, Nigerians are condemning themselves to justify the company’s action. Some of the reasons being adduced include low productivity of Nigerian workers, our destructive nature in the process of stealing equipment and raw materials meant for operations in the firm which sabotage the smooth operation of the business, and the issue of labour strikes. But, the foreign companies in the oil exploration sub-sector use mainly skilled and unskilled Nigerians in their businesses. Why can’t the Dangote refinery do the same? How do they do it that the Dangote firm cannot adopt the same strategies? Maybe there is more to it than we know in the public domain.
The issue of productivity in workplaces is of concern here. I wonder what could have caused low productivity in a country where its citizens are known as workaholics in other countries. Two recent examples in the public sector can be generalised for the whole sector or even the country. One is the Umahi saga and the other is the Tunji-Ojo “wonderment.” 
Governor David Umahi, oh sorry, Minister Umahi, the Minister for Works, was locked in recently when he locked out the ministry’s staff for coming too late for work. The official resumption time should be 8 am but for those who frequent the Federal Secretariat, Abuja, most workers have unofficially changed the resumption time to 9am with closing time from 2pm. Well, the Minister of Works, who has come to work in Abuja, did not know the tradition at the secretariat until he was baptised with the lock-in/lock-out saga. It can be regarded as the height of indolence. In the good old days, as we used to say, it would never have happened. It would not have happened in Ebonyi State where Umahi governed. He has no patience or good record with treatment of labour in the state. Ask the staff of Ebonyi State University. But he had to reach a compromise with the staff of the Ministry of Works. Nobody at the highest echelon of the civil service has made comments or apologised to the minister. The silent behaviour demonstrated was the norm.
Dr Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, the Interior Minister, also very enthusiastic to work and make a difference, instructed the staff of his ministry to clear the messy situation on the outstanding passport he inherited from Rauf Aregbesola. Within a month, over 200,000 outstanding passports were ready for collection! It still looks like a miracle to me. So, all the raw materials and machines to do the work were available but the human kinetic was weak or weary. The productivity was low and needed something to reeve it up. In this case, it was done with the threat of losing their jobs. Someone told me that after six months, the minister would not be able to control the staff anymore. For now, according to the source, the minister is still clean but as time goes on, the staff will compromise him. I hope the minister is listening and attentive. To do what he did, integrity is key and the Nigerian civil service is not in the mood to accommodate any Mr Integrity.  Related News   Private universities have arrived but there’s danger  No warning before next strike, Labour tells FG  Strike: Labour accuses FG of delay, NLC exco meets today   
The two examples are recent and instructive to tell us the nature of the labour in the public sector. The labour in the private sector is not much different even when it is owned by one man and a youth. The question is what is responsible for all the low productivity? We can think of many factors including corruption, poor remuneration, I-don’t-care attitude, poor work environment, get-rich-quick attitude, particularly among the youths or money worshiping and leadership style.      
I want to hazard a guess that the problems start from two joint factors, namely poor remuneration and corruption; with the former reinforcing the accommodation of the latter. As we have explained before, corruption in Nigeria is at the highest level where everybody has been roped in and it requires some revolution from the leadership: the type of revolution that occurred in Singapore. Be that as it may, we all need reorientation about the dignity of labour and labour in dignity.
The Nigerian workers have been short-changed by leadership in many respects. This is particularly true of the lower-level workers who see their oga benefiting from all sorts of contracts and other transactions but sitting on their own promotion and benefits. It is not that the basic salaries of the top officers meet the global standard; it is just that they have more opportunities to pad their salaries than the junior ones: or those in the states who are denied of their monthly salaries in the name of lack of fund when the governors and political appointees are living in affluence.
Some private sector enterprises, particularly the semi-informal, are more interested in making profits at the expense of labour. In the process of survival, workers have to divide their time between primary jobs and secondary jobs. The secondary jobs, which we call moonlight in economics, may be more than one job and the workers give more attention to them than the primary job. It can be expected that most of the workers who came late when the Minister of Works locked the gate had gone to settle the workers in their private enterprises before coming to the ministry where they collect stipend at the end of the month.
The recent announcement to increase wages of workers at the federal level is a good policy which must be extended to the state and possibly private sector as a minimum wage policy. But the labour unions must emphasise the need for workers to become more productive in the interest of the economy after being paid. There should be the need for changing orientation of workers towards improving productivity. Workers who are unable to measure up in productivity scale should be disengaged. It will be difficult to demand higher productivity unless we address the factor that created endemic low productivity but policies must be worked out and implemented decisively. The employers in the public and private sectors must work together through the labour unions with the employees in both sectors to improve national productivity for the advancement of the Nigerian economy.
Lastly, The Federal Government should not carry out the IMF prescription for higher taxes of Nigerians. This is because Nigerians are paying much more tax than is documented. In the IMF world, do people source for electricity and water through personal efforts or through public service? Taxes are derivatives of income. If we grow the national income, more tax revenues will accrue to the government.

No, I have never had the pleasure of meeting him, but I am happy to take this microphone and warmly applaud him.
If you have applied for a passport at any point in the past 40 years, including a renewal, or experienced the application of a relative or a friend at home or abroad, you know how horrendous an experience it is.
You need a lot of money. And time. And boatloads of patience.  When you are done spending each of those, you are often required to find more, sometimes even when your document is declared to be ‘ready’. 
Abroad, the situation is worse, as a quick consultation of Google and YouTube would confirm. As our consulates often mirror the domestic civil service, those offices deliver the same kind of misery.
In each of the past four decades, leaderships of the Ministry – or Internal Affairs, as it used to be – would again and again announce that they were undertaking herculean efforts to improve the system, only to complete their terms of office with the place worse than when they arrived.
Tunji-Ojo appears to have broken the jinx, and according to Vanguard, clearing a backlog of 204,332 passports in less than one month in office.      
The minister, who gives a lot of the credit to Mrs. Wura-Ola Adepoju, the acting Comptroller-General, used a mechanism in which the Nigeria Immigration Service officials worked around the clock, in three shifts, including weekends. I am sure it was more complicated than that, in terms of managing a regime to which civil servants may even have been resistant, but he got the job done.
Congratulations, sir. Hopefully, your colleagues in the government, including Humanitarian minister, Betta Edu, learn from you about putting in the work, not the words.
“Nigerians can trust me,” she was saying on television last week.  “Not just me, the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu,” adding that their watchword(s) is “transparency, accountability and integrity.”
No, Ms. Edu. The watchwords are work and service. The dogged, sweaty stuff – just like Tunji-Ojo – not preachment. Nigerians can recognise the two-faced and the forked-tongue miles away.
On the question of recognition, Seyi Tinubu, the Nigeria leader’s son, is reported to be enjoying life on the presidential jet, recently travelling to a polo game in one.
It must be a wonderful life to sit in one and breathe presidential air, knowing that down below or for hundreds of miles in every direction, millions of people are dying in poverty. That’s not integrity.
But have you ever wondered, dear Nigerian, where the Nigeria Air Force finds parking for all these machines in the air?        
To go back just about 10 years: in mid-2014, the government of Mr. Goodluck Jonathan ordered 40 attack and transportation helicopters for the NAF from the United States and Russia, towards routing Boko Haram insurgents  in parts of the North “once and for all.”  They were all to arrive within weeks.  Related News   Spend N500m fines of inmates on welfare, Falana urges Tunji-Ojo  Interior minister vows to curb passport delay    Invest in education, knowledge, minister urges paramilitary officers   
That was two months before a Nigerian delegation was caught trying to smuggle into South Africa, allegedly to buy arms, $9.3m in cash. They were also shopping for a helicopter. In cash!
In March 2015, SaharaReporters broke the story of how Mr. Jonathan awarded to his friend, the businessman Arthur Eze, a “scandalously inflated” $500m contract for the purchase of refurbished helicopters. Sources told the journal that, in the sheer extravagance apart, the contract had saddled the military with equipment that had limited or no combat utility.
In the middle of 2019, when fighting broke out between the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party over what the APC had done with the $1bn it withdrew from the Excess Crude Account, presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, explained that the Buhari administration paid about $490m of it for the 12 Super Tucano fighter aircraft and “various other military procurements,” with “balance of expenditure” standing at “$880m or so.”  The news media was completely satisfied.
[In November 2018, the US Department of Defense had announced the contract, saying it was for an initial sum of $329m. Although that contract sum could be varied, it explained, it could not exceed $344.7m.]
In March 2021, Leonardo, the Italian defence company, won a €1.2bn contract for 24 M-346 FA light attack aircraft for NAF, in continuation of what Air Cosmos called NAF’s “privileged partnership,” having previously ordered C-27J Spartan, AW109, AW139 as well another AW189 in “presidential configuration.”
“The M-346s will come between the 12 EMB 314 Super Tucano ordered in 2019 and the 3 JF-17C Thunder in service since 2016,” Air Cosmos said. “The multi-purpose aircraft will complement the anti-guerrilla warfare conducted by the Super Tucano in the north of the country and provide air-to-air support to the Thunder for border defence. With this purchase, the NAF will have the most powerful air force in the region, especially since it also has a fleet of armed Chinese CH-3, CH-4, and Wing Loong II drones. Its most serious competitor, Chad, has only three Mig-29 SMs and six Su-25s, as well as aircraft leased from South African private military companies.”      
In August 2021, according to Blogbeforeflight, Nigeria confirmed the M-346 order.
In December 2022, it was announced that President Buhari had approved the delivery of 50 “attack air assets”: six T-129 Atak helicopters, two Augusta 109 Trekker multi-role helicopters three Chinese-made Wing Loong II UAS, and (again) 24 Leonardo- M-346 equipment from 2021.
This is significant because in March this year, with just two months left on the Buhari ledger, NAF said it was seeking 50 aircraft. They included 24 M-346s, 12 Leonardo AW109 Trekker twin-engine multirole helicopters, six Turkish Aerospace Industries T-129 ATAK attack helicopters, three Chengdu Wing Loong II uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), two Beechcraft King Air 360s and four Diamond DA-62s.
On May 27, as the government expired, spokesman Femi Adesina confirmed that orders were in place for 36 additional aircraft, comprising 12 AH-1Z Attack Helicopters and (again!) 24 M-346 Fighter Attack aircraft, and that the force had received 38 brand new aircraft since President Buhari assumed office in 2015.
The NAF, evidently, has a lot of air power, but I am certain we will soon order those 24 multi-purpose M-346s again. And again.
Sadly, as with almost everything in our governments, there is far less accountability about the NAF’s mighty cache of expensive equipment as crime and insecurity run rampant from the creeks of the Delta to the northern borders. There was a lot of gnashing of teeth in the Federal Government, for instance, about the 12 Super Tucano jets, which they swore would alter the insecurity story in the North, until they arrived.
They have made no difference, and a lot more “must-have” jets continue to be bought, perhaps to be stored in the clouds.  
Remember that this is just about one small area of the military, but it is the reason why sons and daughters of the mighty, should they wish to party in the sky, or shoot photos of dancing clouds or go to the toilet somewhere else, simply crook a finger.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/12004318/Sonala-Olumhense.jpg

I will like us to look into it. He wrote, “I like to snack on groundnuts a lot and I noticed that any time I eat without restraints, my LDL cholesterol shoots up to the extent that my doctor had to advise me to stop eating it for some time and that any time I start eating it again, after my cholesterol levels must have normalised, I should do so very moderately and only occasionally. In the light of my experience and in the face of your conclusion and admonition (that people should be eating egunsi), I am a bit confused.”
My response to this is that my stance on the fact that plant foods do not have cholesterol still stands. Groundnut does not contain cholesterol; in fact, it has cholesterol lowering properties. If a particular food is considered healthy, even if it has the World Health Organisation stamp as a superfood but it causes health issues for you, please, abstain from it.
I started discussions on sedentary lifestyle last week. Let us continue.
What are the health risks of an inactive lifestyle? Let us see some: 

Obesity
Heart diseases, including coronary artery disease and heart attack
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Stroke
Metabolic syndrome
Type 2 diabetes
Certain cancers, including colon, breast and uterine cancers
Osteoporosis
Increased feelings of depression and anxiety

Apart from all these, a sedentary lifestyle also appears to have a negative impact on mental well-being. The combination of the physical and mental impact to health makes a sedentary lifestyle particularly problematic. One study with 10,381 participants associated a sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity with a higher risk of developing a mental health disorder. A review that included data from 110,152 participants found a link between sedentary behaviour and an increased risk of depression. The more sedentary you are, the higher your health risks are.
Aimee Layton, Ph.D., an exercise physiologist from Columbia University and a Peloton Health & Wellness Advisory Council member, says, “Simply put: our bodies were not made to be stationary for long periods.”
 How long is too long to sit still?      
Jessica Matthews, DBH, a national board-certified health and wellness coach and assistant professor of Kinesiology and Integrative Wellness at Point Loma Nazarene University, says that “the general recommendation is to reduce prolonged sedentary behaviour to no more than 60 minutes at a time.”
Joe Holder, a Nike Master Trainer and health and wellness consultant, says, “To reduce inactivity, focus on a greater frequency of movement throughout the day. At the end of every hour, aim for three to six minutes of movement. Set an alarm and just stand up, walk around. Do some sit-to-stands from your chair. These exercises break up prolonged periods of sitting and get your blood flowing. I cannot really speak enough about the need for you to let your body do what it was made to do: not sit.”
The WHO guidelines and recommendations provide details for different age groups and specific population groups on how much physical activity is needed for good health. There are recommendations for children under one to two years of age, three to four, five to 17, adults aged 18–64 years, adults aged 65 years and above, pregnant and postpartum women, people living with chronic conditions, children and adolescents living with disability and adults living with disability.
I find the inclusion of the one-two age group so amusing but that shows how concerned the WHO is. Besides, it is good to catch them young. Space will not permit me to talk about all the WHO physical activity guidelines for all the groups, but I will talk about the guideline for adults aged 18-64 years.
 Adults aged 18–64 years:

Should do at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity
Or at least 75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity; or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week.
Should also do muscle-strengthening activities at moderate or greater intensity that involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these provide additional health benefits.
May increase moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to more than 300 minutes; or do more than 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity; or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week for additional health benefits.
Should limit the amount of time spent being sedentary. Replacing sedentary time with physical activity of any intensity (including light intensity) provides health benefits, and,
To help reduce the detrimental effects of high levels of sedentary behaviour on health, all adults and older adults should aim to do more than the recommended levels of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity.

Here are some suggestions on how to fix a sedentary lifestyle:  Related News   FG unveils policy to strengthen Nigeria's lab systems  Embrace health insurance, FCT urges residents  How excessive intake of bitters damage health   

Walk more

Walking has a positive impact on mental health, a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and a positive impact on blood pressure. You can also try adding activities before or after work.        
Look for other opportunities to take a walk.

Take the stairs

A study published in 2017 found stair climbing, considered a vigorous-intensity physical activity, which burns more calories per minute than jogging. Taking the stairs whenever possible can help you maintain a healthy weight as well as build and maintain strong bones, joints and muscles.

Stand up at work

If your job requires you to sit for long periods, make it a point to stand up at least every 20 minutes. You may need to set a reminder.
Try taking brief breaks away from your desk.

Develop a fitness routine

If the thought of going for a run intimidates you, you do not have to run a marathon to enjoy the benefits of fitness. There are many options for exercise, you can set up a workout area at home if you cannot make it to the gym. If you do not like to exercise solo, join a fitness group.

Plant a garden

Any gardener will tell you how much physical effort is involved in every gardening activity. Gardening is mentally and spiritually stimulating and many people find it an enjoyable way to stay active. You can get started with a garden in your own backyard.

Try a fitness tracker

A pedometer is a great way to track your steps. It can help you gauge your activity throughout the day. Knowing your activity can alert you to patterns or habits that lean toward an overly sedentary lifestyle.      
Let me leave you with some quotes just to encourage you:
“Workout till you feel that pain and soreness in muscles. This one is good pain. No pain, no gain.” – Invajy
“I don’t count my sit-ups. I only start counting when it starts hurting because they’re the only ones that count.”–Muhammad Ali
“Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basis of dynamic and creative intellectual activity.” – John F. Kennedy",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/22204250/Olufunke.jpg

On one occasion when a lawyer friend was asked about the type of pain; whether it was banging, intermittent, continuous, needling, piercing, dull or sharp, his response came in one word that bore no resemblance to what he was asked. He simply said that the pain was ‘dementing’. Therefore, many sufferers do not sleep, or they are awoken from sleep because of the pain, or they sleep fitfully at intervals.
The conclusion is simple; the pain is very uncomfortable, and it is a reminder at such times how long the night can be. However, people do not need to be miserable during such circumstances, especially when it is considered that the towns and cities are often unsafe to navigate in the dead of night. It is important to emphasize the night-time misery because that is the period when the pain seems to be most severe. There can be pain during the day, but it is undoubtedly worse at night when patients lie down and more blood rushes towards the head to create engorgement of the various vessels in the entire area. Besides, many other senses are dulled at the point of going into a sleeping mode such that any kind of discomfort appears to be amplified. Body itching and pain of any kind are two of such uncomfortable situations that make sleep nearly impossible.
Tooth decay, called dental caries, remains the most common cause of toothache. This is a condition that often leads to cavities if they are not treated. However, there are many of our compatriots who will tell you that to have dental caries is a feature of advanced age. Although this is a topic we have discussed before on this page, it is important to refresh the memory of what we discussed by reminding ourselves that when acids and bacteria break through the hard enamel of the teeth, they eat away at the softer underlay called the dentine. This often leaves the nerve exposed and pain is a consequence of that. There are various other causes of toothache, and these include such problems as trauma to the jaw, diseases of the gums, losing a dental filling, dental abscess, getting food stuck between the teeth or gums, grinding the teeth at night and eruption of a wisdom tooth. The latter situation arises because the wisdom tooth often pushes its way through the gum and usually just beside another tooth. The pain can be intense.
As usual, one of the most common, frequently available medications found in most homes is paracetamol. Other people may have ibuprofen and even Tylenol. Often, these are quite useful when the pain is mild or even moderately severe. Therefore, they can be readily deployed against toothache and may be effective. They are available with some ease across the counter and many people will already have obtained them in this way for safekeeping at home pending when their usage becomes necessary. Such usage can actually help to keep at bay the day the patient finds it convenient enough to see a dentist. 
This situation arises in conditions in which people who do not have much value for securing proper dental hygiene will still want to delay that visit for as long as possible. When the pain is described as severe, such as the type suffered by the lawyer, it is best to see a dentist as soon as possible once the day breaks. In addition to the use of simple analgesics, it could help to raise the head on an extra pillow because that manoeuvre effectively reduces the amount of blood rushing into the head. Sometimes, two pillows may be needed to create the desired condition for such relief and when it is paired up with the use of a simple analgesic as described above, sleep should be possible.  Related News   Stakeholders counsel dentists on entrepreneurial practice  Utomi makes case for more funding to train Orthodontists  879 foreign-trained doctors, dentists join medical practice in Nigeria   
Additionally, another remedy available in the home for supportive care that is likely to provide some further relief is the use of a cold compress. This can be achieved by first placing the ice in a small bag or napkin before applying the pack to the affected side of the gum or face for 15 to 20 minutes every few hours can also help to reduce such pain. When this is done in the evening before it is time for bed, the cumulative effect can dull the pain so much that the person is able to fall asleep. A cold compress achieves this effect by causing a constriction of the blood vessels around the area thereby helping to reduce the pain. With that, such a person may be able to sleep.
The same effect can be obtained when the mouth is rinsed with warm salt water, which acts to clean up the teeth by removing any food particles that may be stuck between various teeth. Since salt is also harmful to bacteria, it is thought to be another mechanism by which salt water removes such dirt and keeps the teeth clean. Salt water also can help reduce inflammation by removing such offending bacteria and stuck food particles, especially meat. When such particles are not removed, they tend to worsen the general condition of the teeth and gums in the area, thus turning the entire experience into a vicious cycle.      
The use of hydrogen peroxide is able to achieve similar levels of cleanliness of the teeth involved in causing the pain. This compound is very suitable for use by people who suffer from periodonditis, a serious gum disease that is caused by poor oral hygiene. Hydrogen peroxide, therefore, helps to clean the dentition and prevent the development of gum soreness, bleeding and the likelihood of teeth falling out due to loosening within their sockets. However, this compound is not suitable for children because they are most likely to swallow it. In the same way, adults are advised to always dilute the hydrogen peroxide they buy with an equal volume of water before they use the compound. In adults just as in children, it should not be swallowed.
Another common household ingredient that some people deploy for this purpose is garlic. This food additive contains Allicin, a strongly antibacterial compound that may help kill off bacteria within the mouth that cause cavities and tooth pain. Therefore, by chewing a clove of garlic and then allowing it to sit near the site of the pain, such discomfort can be helped a great deal with pain control. However, garlic has a strong smell that many people dislike, and this makes it unsuitable for everyone to use. There are many people on the other hand who will tolerate the smell.
In the same way, clove has been found very useful in controlling toothache and this is validated by a clinical trial in 2015 that demonstrated this fact. As a result, eugenol, the active agent in cloves, was found to be effective in people who had a tooth extraction and subsequently had less inflammation in the course of healing. The effective ingredient is prepared by soaking cloves in water after they have been grounded to make a paste. This paste is then applied to the offending area of the tooth or gum and it helps with pain relief according to the trial. It is important to avoid swallowing cloves because they can be spiky and painful. This is even more of a concern in children. Generally speaking, it is not compulsory to turn the clove into a paste before it can be used; single cloves can be chewed and then left in the cavity or area where the pain is originating to help with pain relief. Onions have similarly been found useful in dealing with toothache and after chewing it, it can be spat out when the pain has begun to reduce.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/15201925/Dr.-Sylvester-Ikhisemojie.jpg

Many thanks for your articles on sexual purity. I saw them at a time when I saw some of my friends who had ‘given out their virginity’ having several boyfriends doing very well and I felt really bad such that I had sleepless nights not because they were doing well, but because it seemed like giving it out made them to be ahead of me. I have a passion for modelling and hope to be a beauty queen some day, but it seems that in this age one has to either give sex or bribe your way to winning, and it’s so frustrating. Sometimes, it just seems like everything is against me, but I try to endure and I pray that my waiting and hard work will pay off. It’s really not easy to stay chaste in this generation. Love you mama!
Miss O.22
Dear Miss O.22, 
First, who’s a runs girl? A runs girl is described as any lady who is blatantly lazy or not content with her salary, income and allowance because her personal income can’t get her to her destination. She uses her beauty and physical attributes, which include sex, to gain monetary favours, promotion, land, cars and jewellery from any man who is willing to pay.
Sincerely, the first thought that comes to mind is “Why would anyone consider choosing the devil over God?” On the other hand, I understand the fact that your orientation, background and upbringing, which form your values and beliefs, and above all, personal conviction and relationship with God go a long way in determining your thoughts about life and your actions! We are also at a time when the devil has taken over the world and the hearts of most humans. We are all surrounded by these people. And unless God has your undivided and non-distracted attention, you can’t help but feel the way you do! In fact, the devil will make you see every reason why you should start getting all you want using your body as merchandise!
What have these friends of yours achieved that no one in the world has achieved my sweet? What do they currently possess that you won’t eventually have tones of? When you load your life with all types of spirits and demons from diverse sex partners, you will always pay for it! A lot of them are already finished! You’d be shocked to see how they’ll turn out in the future after they’ve flung away what should make them shine in life and rule their world through multiple sex partners, while you will be enjoying a glorious life/the rewards of being obedient to God like life was created for you alone!      
When you trade your body with the wondrous virtues you’re imbued with, you’re fast becoming a living dead! Believe it or not, as you part with what should make you comfortable for life and lay the world at your feet, your life is opened to demonic invasion and the devil doesn’t want you to live an optimal life and align with God’s divine agenda for you! Don’t you get it? What good can come out of disrespecting the temple of the Holy Spirit? (1 Cor.6:19-20).  Related News   
You need to concentrate more on God and let your capabilities/imagination bring to you what your friends can never have even if they slept with all the men in the world!
Separate yourself from sexually active unmarried friends before they mess you up for life.
Worship at a church or fellowship that emphasises holiness and the narrow way, constantly bombarding you with scriptures and firing up your spirit and further pushing you to do things God’s way each time you attend service! Remember the word of God is described as a double-edged sword, which penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit (Hebrews 4:12). Let it control you and you will be pleasantly amazed at what becomes of you and what comes to you!
For everyone in her shoes
Your staying chaste will not be in vain! God has your continuous assessment and will reward you in a way that will shake your entire generation in Jesus mighty name.
I invite you to follow me on Facebook –TEMILOLU OKEOWO and Instagram @Okeowotemilolu

We met at a point that each of us was eager to settle down. He always told me that women had taken advantage of him so much that he was losing faith in matters of the heart.
Within a few months of intense communication, we began to plan my visit to his base.
We agreed that I would be there for a month and if I liked his space and the environment, we could start working towards my relocation and career plans. 
In addition to being a businessman, he is also a pastor. One evening that we were talking, he told me that someone was coming to him for prayers.
He said it was a man. This was happening around 7pm and he needed to inform me in case I called and he was unreachable.
So, when I called him around 10pm and he was sounding distracted, I asked if the person was still there. And he said that the fellow just got there as he was delayed by traffic.      
I immediately began to feel uneasy about the whole prayer story. In fact, what came to my mind was a gay scenario.
That very night, I had a dream where I found myself in his home. In that dream, I emerged from the bedroom, passed by the swimming pool and headed to the sitting room when a lady (in a white bikini) emerged from the shadows and blocked my way, forming a barrier between the two of us.
A few days later, I relayed the dream to him and he was silent for a moment before clearing his throat to say that I had just described his house without even visiting yet.
The interesting thing is that the relationship began to lose its flow from the moment of that night of prayer.
By the time the date for my supposed trip to his station came close, we were no longer communicating as such, despite the fact that my flight ticket had been paid for by him.
Within two months, I learned that he was married to another woman.  Related News   FG okays $3.45bn W’Bank loan application for power, others  Explore the power of the active voice  FG grows national grid power capacity to 14,000MW   
Another thing that I also learned was that that was his third marriage and he was HIV-positive!        
Barely two years down the line, in another dream, I kept seeing a man who was trying to hold my hand. He was loving and seemed to be present wherever I went in that dream. Moments later, a vague figure began to tell me about that same man.
It was more like explaining his personal attributes to me, most of which were positive. As the figure reeled off his attributes, I kept nodding and at a time, I asked, ‘Does he have money’?
The moment I asked that question, the figure shut down towards me and exited through her right side.
This was some years back. Because I am married today to a man who had been in my space all along but I just didn’t see him in that ‘husband’ light.
He has not only given me a wonderful marriage experience, but also adorable children and our combined economic output gives us a very comfortable life.
–          From Oby…
What these experiences teach is how powerful the mind (which I believe is the spirit of God in us) is when it comes to guiding us towards what is good for us or protecting us from that which means harm.      
Another lesson here is the place of sincerity of heart in our quests.
Sincerity purifies the mind. And when the mind is clean, the spirit of God comes in and does His job.
Please understand that desperation is not sincerity.
Desperation is just your selfish desire that is frustrated, because what it wants is not happening fast enough.
Where there’s desperation, manipulation is a given!",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/08070231/Chukwuneta-Oby1.jpg

As a couple and intended parents, it is likely that you have already spent years and money attempting to conceive. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to realise that while surrogacy may not offer you the pregnancy experience you desire, it can still provide you with the parental experience you seek.
Speaking with your infertility counsellor and a surrogacy specialist is the best method to assess if surrogacy after infertility is appropriate for you. This is so because they can help you understand what to expect from the surrogacy process and if you fit the standards for intended parents considering surrogacy.
However, the choice to explore surrogacy following infertility is entirely up to you and your spouse or partner. Based on the fact that this is such a personal decision to make, it’s important to discuss it in detail with each other to determine if it’s the right infertility option for your situation.
While it’s always important to talk to a medical professional to find out if surrogacy is right for you, there are also some questions that you and your partner should ask yourselves if you’re considering surrogacy. For instance, are you ready to give up on every other infertility treatment? Do you want another woman to carry and bear your child? These are issues. 
Many times, as intending parents, you are obliged to choose surrogacy after infertility, because you have already gone through years of fertility treatments with no success. You’ve already spent a fortune on assisted reproductive technologies like IVF that, unexpectedly, failed repeatedly to result in a pregnancy of your own. So, when you start considering surrogacy after infertility, it’s usually because you know the treatments that you are currently using are not working and may not likely work in the future.
If this is the situation you’re in, surrogacy may be the next step for you. However, you should be ready to move forward from the other infertility treatments and accept that they may not result in the success you hoped for. If you are still holding out hope that a process like IVF will result in a pregnancy of your own, you may not be ready to move from infertility to surrogacy quite yet. Surrogacy does require a lot of time, money and energy, which, to be most effective, should not be split between multiple assisted reproductive technology methods.
One of the biggest challenges as an intended parent when deciding to pursue surrogacy is giving up the chance that you might carry your own child to term yourself. Many intended mothers have dreamed for a long time of being pregnant, and letting go of that dream can be difficult. However, it’s crucial to having a successful surrogacy experience.

Intending parents who choose to pursue surrogacy do so because they recognise what’s really important to them: being parents. Once you realise that being pregnant is not the goal – having a child is – you will be more willing to embrace the surrogacy process. However, if you’re not ready to let go of your desire to be pregnant and the difficult emotions tied up in that, you may not be ready to move from infertility to surrogacy.
Now to the big question: Are you ready to let someone else carry your baby? When you let go of the dream of being pregnant yourself, you must also be comfortable relinquishing control over your baby’s in-utero development. Surrogacy is an intimate partnership between the intended parents and a surrogate, and you must be prepared for that relationship before you begin the surrogacy process.
This is one of the biggest challenges for intending parents (mothers, especially). It should comfort you to know that all surrogates are thoroughly screened to make sure they’re physically and mentally ready for the responsibilities of surrogacy. You will also sign a legal contract with your surrogate detailing what the expectations are for her, while she carries your unborn child. Still, you must be prepared to place a good deal of trust in your surrogate.
Discussing your medical alternatives with your infertility counsellor is always a crucial part of the infertility journey, especially if you’re contemplating surrogacy. Surrogacy may not be appropriate for everyone’s unique scenario. Before devoting time and attention to the surrogacy process, consult with a family-building specialist to evaluate whether it is a viable choice for you and your spouse. If you are feeling trapped with your present infertility alternatives and are seeking a fresh family-building procedure, a professional can provide the finest guidance.
Before proceeding with the surrogacy procedure, it is critical that both you and your spouse are equally dedicated to the family-building process. Surrogacy necessitates an emotional investment; therefore, if you and your spouse are not emotionally prepared, you will likely encounter some challenges along the way, including feelings of resentment, anger and disappointment.
You and your partner should honestly discuss your feelings before starting the process. It may be a good idea to involve your fertility therapist as well to have the most productive conversation possible.
Before pursuing surrogacy after infertility, it is crucial to conduct thorough research to determine if it is the right choice for you and your partner. Surrogacy is a complex process that requires a significant commitment of time, money and energy. It is essential to be confident in surrogacy before starting. An experienced surrogacy professional will guide you through the process and educate you about potential challenges.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/06003853/Abayomi-Ajayi.jpg

But my goodness, at a high cost! The pain of ulcer for 30 years is no joke and still she was working as a doctor. Actually, it wasn’t pain, but the agony of leg ulcer; having to stand on her feet that were bandaged up. This has led me down the route of thinking about how some people are open to let people know they live with SCD and some people want to keep their health issues to themselves. I am talking about those whom sickle cell disease affects.
A lot of people living with sickle cell disease do not want others to know that they are living with this life-long disease. What is it about sickle cell that will make one keep quiet about it? After all, to be ill is normal and illnesses come in various grades. Cold, headache and fever are also illnesses. There are several reasons why people want to keep living with an illness secret.
The fear of being teased or harassed by colleagues is a factor that cannot be ignored in the workplace.   There is the possibility of one’s career progress being stalled if one exposes that one lives with a long-term illness, like sickle cell.
Living with a chronic illness affects so many areas of one’s life negatively. A lot of people do not talk about living with sickle cell and part of the reason is because it may make them look weak. Another reason could be that one wants to fit in with others. There is also the worry of people not wanting to have a relationship with one. 
Some tend to hide their illness under the mask of wellness. Pretending that they can go out in the cold, go skiing in a -20 degrees weather; or go running every morning with others when the weather is cold outside. The truth of the matter is if one mentions living with a disease, people may look at one and think maybe one is lying or one is being self-centred.
What those who are living with a long-term illness do is to show others that they can do well by being the best person in the class, or they can be the best in their chosen fields in spite of living with sickle cell.  This could be on the level of, ‘I can also be as competitive as my competitors and I will show them I can achieve it’.
Another reason is societal judgments. This can be from peers, colleagues, schoolmates, bullies and even family members. We seem to forget that illness is normal and part of life. The fact is sometimes society does not want to confront illness. This is perhaps the reason why someone who lives with a long-term illness will pretend and not want to talk about it to family members, because of their judgments.      
Not wanting people to know can in turn make it difficult for the person to go to the hospital and seek medical support when required. This can also lead to diagnosis being delayed or not wanting to find out that one has this illness. This can lead to lies about their symptoms or looks.  Related News   Sickle Cell and Dr Hendricks (Part 3)  Laycon bares his heart on industry bullying, Mohbad, living with sickle cell disease  Sickle Cell and Dr Hendricks (Part 2)   
The unfortunate thing about sickle cell is that as a person grows older, there could be physical manifestations that become visible. For example, one could have Avascular Necrosis. No person is immune to this complication as they grow older with sickle cell. According to the Sickle Cell Society, as one grows older, other complications of sickle cell manifest, such as permanent damage to at least one organ, vision loss, bone health, (as stated above), pain, and other chronic complications.
There is no doubt that there is a stigma attached to living with a long-term illness and it can be challenging living with a long-term disease. Sickle cell, for example, is hidden, by that I mean, it is not a disease that is visible, unlike if someone had a sore all over their lips.
The issue of stigma is real. Many people living with sickle cell have lived through all sorts of prejudice because of this disease. This has involved all kinds of misrepresentations in different areas of one’s life. For example, looking at one’s lifestyle and judging, it could be held against one professionally, or socially; one could be denied a job. Lastly, could this also affect one’s romantic relationship? These are tough questions that the person living with sickle cell will come across.
Sometimes, it could be that one does not want to burden those close to one. There is no doubt that knowing will create anxiety in the hearts of others. Whatever reasons we may have for not letting others know are valid, but is it the best way to go about things?
Are we truly protecting those close to us or is it because we are ashamed that we are living with a disability? Hiding sickle cell can also be a sort of coping mechanism for dealing with crises.  Sometimes, one will do things that can be outrageous in order to mask the pain that one is going through.
Is keeping sickle cell a secret such a bad thing? Can one not argue that it is actually no one’s business and one should only share with whom one wants to share with? It is easy to not speak about it because sickle cell is unseen. And yet, can we be doing ourselves disfavour by keeping quiet?

A father and mother, in the context of Africa, won’t necessarily mean those who had given birth to you biologically, but also those who stand in places of authority or those who have cared for you over time
Honouring your father and mother is being respectful in word and action and having an inward attitude of esteem for their position.
From a religious perspective, whether you are a Christian or a Muslim, we are enjoined to honour and obey our parents, respect their opinion, and be kind to them.

We should accept, respect our parents, and revere them even when we share divergent opinions.

So this raised the issue of why some married men keep mistresses for so long without intending to marry them or leave their families for them.
So our main focus is ‘When a man’s side chick marries’.
A website went into men’s perspectives and the reasons why they have affairs even when they are married. 
Speaking on why married men feel bad when their mistresses marry, the site revealed that they miss the physical intimacy they have with their mistresses and the adventure.  Related News   Celebs who got married secretly  Married man abandons girlfriend in Lagos hotel room, rapes receptionist  At 55, I married as a virgin –Osun newly-wed woman   
Some miss the freedom to be real without getting judged and the time spent together.
Talking on why those men don’t marry their mistresses, the website stated that cheating men don’t leave their wives for side chicks due to their image.      
Men recognise the elevated status they have in society as married people and do not want to lose it. Many of these deceitful men are well-respected members of society.

Election season in Nigeria is one that can turn violent in the blink of an eye as we have all seen in the past years.
  
Therefore, we ask, why do you as supporters of the different political candidates, have to insult, curse and be aggressive to one another to drive home a point?
 
Are all of those necessary? Are we preparing for war or just an election? Can we stop beating the drums of war?

As the days to the election draw closer and as they turn to hours and minutes, let us all remember that voting wisely is the only way we can get the Nigeria we want. The Nigeria that flows with milk and honey. The Nigeria that our children unborn would be proud to call home.
 
Are you ready to cast your vote?

Since the policy was announced, many Nigerians have been depositing their money in banks, but some of the banks and automated teller machines have continued to dispense old naira notes.
